<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>When I first decided to write a short account
of the Post Office of India my intention was
to close my story with the amalgamation of
the Post Office and the Telegraph Department,
which took place in 1913. Publication has been
delayed for various reasons, chiefly owing to the outbreak
of the war in 1914, and since then many strange things
have happened. Consequently I have had to revise several
chapters and felt compelled to write one upon the wonderful
work done by the Indian Post Office in the Great
War. I have also brought the statistical information up to
the year 1918. Much of the matter referring to the early
posts in India has already been given in Mr. Hamilton's
book, <i>An Outline of Postal History and Practice</i>. This is
only natural, as we have both drawn from the same
sources&mdash;namely, the records of the Postal Directorate in
Calcutta. I have tried to tell the story of the Post Office
in such a way as to be interesting to the general reader
as well as useful to the student. The ordinary routine of
post office work is not exciting, but the effect of the
work, the benefits it confers, the dependence of the
public upon its proper execution, are themes to inspire
the pen of a romantic writer. "The Romance of the
Post Office" was the title of a delightful article in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> by Sir Arthur Fanshawe, late
Director-General of the Department, and to this article
I must acknowledge my obligations for several passages
in the book.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to Mr. R. W. Hanson and Mr.
F. F. Shout, Assistant Directors-General of the Post
Office of India, for their assistance in producing this
work. Mr. Hanson is responsible for the chapter on
"The Post Office in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf,"
and Mr. Shout for the chapter on "The Sea Post
Office" and the paragraphs dealing with the District
Post, as well as for the Index.</p>

<p>The chapter upon Indian stamps is based largely upon
<i>The Postage and Telegraph Stamps of British India</i>, by
Hausburg, Stewart-Wilson and Crofton, published by
Messrs. Stanley Gibbons, and I am greatly indebted
to Messrs. Stanley Gibbons for the loan of their blocks
and for permission to use them in this book.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

THE POST OFFICE OF INDIA</h2>


<p>To anyone connected with the work of the
Post Office of India it is almost inconceivable
that the present institution, with its vast
organization and its elaborate system, has
grown up in the course of little more than half a century.
Previous to 1854 the Post Office was a medley of services
in different provinces, each having separate rules and
different rates of postage. Regular mails were conveyed
over a very few main lines between important towns, and
Collectors of districts were responsible for the management
of their own local post offices. There were no
postage stamps, and since rates were levied according to
distance, and distances were often unknown, the position
of a postal clerk in a large office was a distinctly lucrative
one. In large cantonments a military officer with plenty
of other duties was usually postmaster, and his supervision
was at best sketchy, especially during the snipe
shooting season.</p>

<p>In 1850 a Commission of the kind with which we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
now so familiar both in India and England was appointed
to consider the state of the postal services, and the result
of its deliberations was the Post Office Act of 1854 and
the conversion of the Post Office into an Imperial Department
under a single head called the Director-General.
Uniform rates of postage were introduced and postage
stamps instead of cash payments were brought into use.
That marvellous set of rules known as the Post Office
Manual was prepared, which has since grown into four
healthy volumes. Every Official in the Department is
supposed to have the contents of these at his fingers'
ends, but in reality few have ever read them through,
and anyone who attempted to obey all their instructions
would find himself sadly hampered in the exercise of his
duties. The appointment of a Director-General, by
bringing the separate services under a single administration,
laid the foundation for future progress. Suitable
officers were recruited and were taught their duties,
better pay and improved prospects of promotion were
a great inducement to the staff to take an interest in
the work, and through communications which took
no account of district or provincial boundaries were
established.</p>

<p>The gradual growth of the powers of the Director-General
has largely depended on the needs of the Department,
and also, to an appreciable extent, upon his own
strength of will and his personal relations with the
Member of Council, who controls the Department of
Government to which the Post Office is subordinate.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The Director-General is assisted by two Deputy
Directors, who are, in fact, the Secretaries of the Post
Office, and under these again are four Assistant Directors
in charge of four main branches of Post Office work. All
the above officers have the title "General" attached to
their designations in order to increase their self-respect,
but I have omitted it to avoid an annoying reiteration.
Of the three personal assistants, one has to be a walking
encyclopædia since he is in personal attendance on the
Director-General; the others are financial and technical
experts. The office itself is under the immediate supervision
of a titled Bengalee gentleman of considerable
attainments, and his clerks are mostly Bengalee graduates
whose abilities are supposed to vary with their
salaries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>For the purposes of administration, the whole of India
and Burma is divided into eight circles, corresponding
with Presidencies and Provinces as far as possible. Each
of these is under the control of a Postmaster-General,
who is sometimes a member of the Indian Civil Service
and sometimes an official of the Department. The
powers of a Postmaster-General are great, his patronage
is large and the working of the Post Office is dependent
on his capacity for railway travelling at all seasons of the
year. His circle is divided into divisions in charge of
Superintendents, who should be little understudies of
himself.</p>

<p>The real business of the Department, however, is performed
by post offices, and these are divided into head,
sub and branch offices. The head office is the account
and controlling office of one or more districts and is in
charge of a postmaster, who in large towns ranks as a
divisional officer. The sub-office is under the control of
a head office for account purposes. It does all kinds of
postal work and is always opened where there is a sufficiency
of correspondence to justify its existence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
branch office is only intended for villages and places
where there is no need of a sub-office. It is really the
pioneer of the Department for the purpose of opening
up new areas to postal communications. In small places
a branch office is put in charge of a schoolmaster, a shopkeeper
or any other local resident who has sufficient
education to keep the very simple accounts required, and
by this means the Post Office is able to give the advantages
of its great organization to villages which could
never support a departmental office. A still cheaper
agency is used for the outlying hamlets, which only receive
and send a few letters a week. These are visited
periodically by the village or rural postman, who is a kind
of perambulating branch office. He delivers letters and
money orders, and also receives articles for despatch. He
sells stamps and quinine, and being a local man he has to
face a certain amount of public opinion if he doesn't act
fair and square towards the villagers in his beat. In some
hill tracts he is provided with a bugle to announce his
arrival, and to the inhabitants of these he brings news of
the outside world; he writes their letters and explains
to them his own conception of the mysteries of the money
order system.</p>

<p>But what would be the use of all these offices and all
this organization without lines of communication? The
chief lines are, of course, the railways, but they form a
separate organization and will be discussed in another
chapter. For places off the railway there are motor lines
and tonga services, such as that sung by Kipling between
Kalka and Simla but now a thing of the past owing to
the completion of the hill railway. The romance of the
Post Office, however, must always lie in the mail runner,
or hirkara as he is called in old books on India. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
number of tigers sated with his flesh is past count, the
Himalayan snows have overwhelmed him, flooded rivers
have carried him off and oozy swamps sucked him down.
But in the face of all these dangers, has the runner ever
failed to do his duty? According to the stories, never,
and in real life perhaps not more than once or twice.</p>

<div class="poem">
Is the torrent in spate? He must ford it or swim.<br />
Has the rain wrecked the road? He must climb by the cliff.<br />
The service admits not a but, nor an if,<br />
While the breath's in his mouth, he must bear without fail<br />
In the name of the Emperor&mdash;the "Overland Mail."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kipling.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Postal runners are largely drawn from the less civilized
races of India, many of whom are animists by religion.
They will face wild beasts and wandering criminals, but
will go miles to avoid an evil spirit in a tree. With them
the mail bag is a kind of fetish which must be protected
and got to its destination at all costs. Dishonesty among
them is almost unknown and they are wonderfully true to
their salt, which with them seldom exceeds twelve rupees
a month. To prove that the old stories are not all myths,
a case came before the Director-General recently in a
rather peculiar manner. The Audit Office, that soulless
machine which drives executive officers out of their
minds, sent in an objection to a gratuity being given to
the family of a runner who, when carrying the mails, had
been eaten by a tiger. The objection was that gratuities
were only given for death in special circumstances, for
instance, when death occurred in the performance of
some specially courageous action, and that, since carrying
the mails was part of the man's ordinary duty, his
family was not entitled to any consideration. The actual
story of the runner's death, as told by the villagers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the village watchman, is this: The runner's beat had
been recently frequented by a man-eating tiger, and
several of the country people had been carried off by
him during the previous few days. On the afternoon in
question the tiger was known to be in the neighbourhood,
and when the mails arrived the villagers warned the
runner not to go then, but to wait until next morning.
Since the man-eater was an early feeder&mdash;that is to say,
he killed his prey early in the afternoon, the runner
waited until five o'clock and then persuaded the village
watchman to accompany him. He hadn't gone more than
two miles when out came the tiger and seized him. The
watchman escaped and took the mails to the next stage,
and the family of the man who nobly faced death in the
execution of his duty was deprived of its wage-earner.
This is a very bald account of a really heroic deed, and
it is pleasing to learn that Mr. Levett Yeats, the Accountant-General
of the Post Office at the time, who was
the very soul of romance and chivalry, dealt with his
objecting subordinate in a manner worthy of the heinous
nature of his offence.</p>

<p>The road establishment of the Indian Post Office
amounted to 18,160 persons out of a total staff of 108,324
on the 31st March, 1918, so there is some excuse for
having devoted so much space to it. The postal staff
had to deal with over 1200 millions of articles during
the year, of which, according to the Annual Report of
1917-18, only .22 per cent failed to reach their proper
destination. When one considers that there are more
than twenty written languages in India in common use,
and that a large number of addresses are almost illegible
and are mixed up with invocations to the Deity and many
other high-sounding phrases, one can only say, "Bravo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the Post Office! How do you do it?" With such a large
correspondence a handsome revenue might be expected,
even when the minimum rate for letters is a halfpenny;
but the Indian is a frugal person and he does most of his
correspondence on farthing postcards, on which he can
cram a great deal of information by carefully using every
available portion. Postcards were introduced in 1879
and now account for nearly half of the articles handled.
The private card, with a figure of some favourite god or
goddess, is competing strongly with the ordinary Government
postcard, and wonderful ingenuity is employed to
enable the writer to avail himself of more space than the
regulations permit. The unpaid letter is also much in
evidence in India. There is an idea that a letter on
which postage has to be collected is much more certain
to reach its destination than a prepaid one. This heretical
doctrine has been strongly condemned in several
pamphlets issued by the Director-General, but with
little effect. And who knows? Perhaps there is a
certain amount of truth in it, founded on bitter experience.
Unpaid postcards had to be abolished
recently, when it was discovered that they were universally
read and then returned to the postmen as
refused. The writer generally concealed his identity
from the officials, with the result that it was useless
to try and recover the postage due.</p>

<p>Among a suspicious and ignorant people any innovation
is likely to be looked at askance, and this is especially the
case in India, where the introduction of postcards was
received with suspicion, although their low price ensured
a ready sale. An extract from the <i>Amrita Bazar Patrika</i>,
one of the foremost Indian papers, shows that they were
not at first regarded as an unmixed blessing. The extract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
is taken from the issue of the 18th July, 1879, and is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Postal cards are now a rage all over India. There
are men who, to make the contents of the cards unintelligible,
make them altogether illegible. Some express
themselves in hints which are not only unintelligible to
the postal clerk and peon, but to the person addressed
also. Others have got a notion that all letters, to be sent
either through the Post or through private harkaras,
must be written on postcards, that being the hookum<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
of the Sirkar; and it is not unusual to see a fat and
ignorant, though extremely loyal and law-abiding,
zemindar<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> sending his letters to his steward written on
half a score of postcards, one or two not sufficing to contain
his great thoughts. There are others who write
their thoughts on postcards and enclose them in an
envelope, and attach a half-anna stamp before posting.
These men have naturally raised a loud complaint against
the unconscionable exactions of Government, and native
papers given to writing sedition should not let slip this
opportunity of indulging their profitable pastime. But
the great difficulty is to teach the people on which side
of the card the address is to be written, and we think it
will be some years before they are enlightened in this
respect. But really does it matter much if the address
is written on the wrong side? We think that the people
of India living under the enlightened rule of the British
should have the privilege of writing the address on
whichever side they like."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>What a merry time the poor sorters would have if the
sentiments expressed in the last sentence were given
effect to! But doubtless the <i>Amrita Bazar Patrika</i>, with
its enlightened staff, its splendid circulation and carefully
printed addresses would scarcely maintain the same
opinions now.</p>

<p>The Post Office of India must be congratulated upon
its good fortune in never having been regarded by
Government as a revenue-producing Department, and as
long as it paid its way with a small surplus the Powers
were satisfied. Any excess was devoted to improvements
in the service, and full advantage has been given to this
concession in past years by the introduction of many
reforms destined to meet the growing needs of the
country. Recently, postage rates were reduced to such
an extent that for a few years the Post Office worked at
a loss, a most unsatisfactory state of affairs; however,
a marked recovery is noticeable already and it is again a
self-supporting institution, the gross revenue for the
year ending the 31st March, 1918, being more than
416 lakhs<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of rupees, which gave a net surplus of nearly
50 lakhs on the year's working.</p>

<p>From being merely an agency for the conveyance and
distribution of letters and light articles, the Post Office
has gradually undertaken an enormous amount of what
may be called non-postal work. It deals with vast
numbers of money orders, collects the price of goods
for tradesmen, pays pensioners, sells quinine, deals in
Government loans, and is the poor man's bank, all of
which matters will be dealt with separately. It is to be
hoped that no new line of business is going to be taken
up in the near future, such as the sale of railway tickets,
which was once seriously proposed, or else the principal
duty of the Department may be forgotten in the turmoil
of the side shows.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

THE ORIGIN OF THE POST OFFICE</h2>


<p>The Postal System of India, like that of other
countries, had its origin in the necessity of
maintaining communication throughout the
various parts of a great Empire in order that
the Emperor might be kept continuously informed of
what was taking place and might be able to keep in
constant touch with the officers in charge of Provinces
at a distance from the Capital. When Ibn Batuta was
travelling in India in the middle of the fourteenth
century he found an organized system of couriers
established throughout the country governed at that
time by the great Mahomed Din Tughlak. The system
seems to have been very similar to that which existed in
the Roman Empire, and is thus described:</p>

<p>"There are in Hindustan two kinds of couriers, horse
and foot; these they generally term 'El Wolak.' The
horse-courier, which is generally part of the Sultan's
cavalry, is stationed at a distance of every four miles.
As to the foot-couriers there will be one at the distance
of every mile occupying stations which they call 'El
Davah' and making on the whole three miles; so that
there is, at the distance of every three miles, an inhabited
village, and without this, three sentry boxes where the
couriers sit prepared for motion with their loins girded.
In the hands of each is a whip about two cubits long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and upon the head of this are small bells. Whenever,
therefore, one of the couriers leaves any city he takes
his despatches in one hand and the whip, which he
keeps constantly shaking, in the other. In this manner
he proceeds to the nearest foot-courier and, as he approaches,
shakes his whip. Upon this out comes another
who takes the despatches and so proceeds to the next.
For this reason it is that the Sultan receives his despatches
in so short a time."</p>

<p>Some of the oldest runners' lines in India were
established for the purpose of conveying fruit and flowers
to famous temples, and Colonel Broughton in his most
interesting book, <i>Letters from a Mahratta Camp</i>, describes
one such line between Udeypore and Pushkar in Rajputana.
In his <i>Historical Sketches of the South of India</i>,
Colonel Wilks tells us that among the earliest measures
of Raja Chick Deo Raj of Mysore, who came to the
throne in 1672, was the establishment of a regular
post throughout his dominions. The Post Office in
Mysore was not merely an ordinary instrument for conveying
intelligence, but an extraordinary one for obtaining
it. The postmasters were confidential agents of the
Court and the inferior servants were professed spies, who
made regular reports of the secret transactions of the
districts in which they were stationed. This system,
which was more fully developed by Hyder Ali, became
a terrible instrument of despotism. The Moghul
Emperors kept up a regular system of daks, and Ferishta
tells us that Sher Shah, during his short reign of five
years, 1541-1545, was the first who ever employed a
mounted post in India. He constructed a road from
Sonarung in Bengal to the banks of the Indus in Sind, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
distance of two thousand miles, and placed two horses
on the road at every two miles. The Emperor Akbar
had post houses built at stages ten miles apart on the
principal roads and swift Turki horses were placed at
each stage. One of these post houses can still be seen
on the road between Agra and Sikandra.</p>

<p>The British do not appear to have found any established
system of communication when they began to extend
their dominion in India, and in the beginning of the
eighteenth century it was a matter of no small difficulty
to send a letter more than a distance of one hundred miles.
A regular postal system was first introduced by Lord
Clive in 1766, and the zemindars or landholders along
the various routes were held responsible for the supply
of runners to carry the mails. For this service a deduction
was made in their rents in proportion to the number of
runners supplied. The order recorded in the Minutes of
Consultations of the 24th March is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">For the Better Regulation of Dauks</span>"</p>

<p>"Ordered that in future all letters be despatched
from the Government House; the postmaster or his
assistant attending every night to sort and see them sent
off; that the letters to the different Inland Settlements
be made up in separate bags, sealed with the Company's
seal; that none may open the packets except the Chiefs
at the different places, who are to open only their own
respective packets; and</p>

<p>"Ordered that they be directed to observe the same
rule with respect to the letters sent down to Calcutta."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following is an extract from the Public Proceedings
7th July, 1766;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As there have been of late frequent miscarriages of
packets to and from Madras without possibility of
tracing the cause, not knowing the stages where they do
happen, as no advice is ever sent us by the neighbouring
Residencies, and as this on any emergency may be
attended with the worst of consequences, it is agreed to
establish the following Rules and communicate them to
the Presidency of Madras, recommending the same to
be circulated to the factories and Residencies subordinate
to them, as we shall do to those dependent on
Bengal:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That the packets henceforward be numbered in
regular succession for the present season from this time
to the end of the year, and in future from the 1st January
to the last of December.</p>

<p>"That the day and hour of despatch as well as the
number be noted on the tickets affixed to the packets;
that on every packet the number and date of the next
preceding despatch be noted.</p>

<p>"That in order to have the earliest information of
the loss of a packet at any time, the Resident or Chief
of a factory shall regularly give advice of the receipt of
each packet to the Resident of the stage from whence it
came last.</p>

<p>"That when any packets are found to be missing the
Chiefs or Residents at the two nearest stages shall immediately
make it their business to examine the Dauks or
Tappies very particularly, and punish them severely
when they do not give a satisfactory account how the
packets came to be lost, giving advice in the meantime
to each Presidency.</p>

<p>"That the Postmaster at Calcutta and Residents at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Balasore, Cuttack and Ganjam do keep separate registers
of despatches to and from Madras.</p>

<p>"That all packets be sealed with the Governor's as
well as the Company's seal to prevent their being opened
till they arrive at the destined place.</p>

<p>"And as we have reason to believe that by proper
attention to the Tappies, the communication with
Madras may be more expeditious, particularly between
Vizagapatam and Bandermalanka, where making allowances
for passing the Rivers, it is remarked they are
very tardy, it is agreed to write to the gentlemen at
Madras to mention this to their subordinate factories
that they may fall upon proper measures to remedy
it, and recommending small boats or saugarees to be
stationed at the different rivers."</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the administration of Warren Hastings the Post
Office in India was placed on a better footing and steps
were taken to make the posts which were established for
official purposes more generally available for private communications.
In January, 1774, the details of a regular
system were laid down, which was brought into force on
the 31st March, 1774. A Postmaster-General was appointed
and postage was charged for the first time on
private letters. The lowest rate of letter postage was
two annas per hundred miles, and copper tickets of the
value of two annas, to be used solely for postal purposes,
were specially struck for public convenience.</p>

<p>In November, 1784, revised regulations for the Post
Office were laid down which took effect in the province
of Bengal from December of that year. In 1785 Madras
followed suit upon proposals made by Mr. J. P. Burlton,
a junior civilian in Government service. He suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the adoption of a regular postal system on the lines of
Bengal, under which all letters except those on the public
service should pay postage. In 1786 Mr. Archibald Campbell
was made Postmaster-General, Madras, and arrangements
were made for fortnightly services to Calcutta and
Bombay. There was some dispute between the Court
of Directors and the Madras Government regarding the
appointment of a Postmaster-General. The former refused
to accept Mr. Campbell and nominated Mr.
Burlton; the latter objected to Mr. Burlton and
appointed Mr. Legge Wilks, who was shortly afterwards
succeeded by Mr. Oliver Colt.</p>

<p>For the next fifty years the history of the Post Office
is obscure. The territory occupied by the East India
Company in 1784 consisted of three isolated portions
adjoining the three presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras
and Bombay. The Company obtained the administrative
control of part of the Carnatic and the provinces
known as the Northern Circars in 1761. The fiscal
administration of the provinces of Bengal, Behar and
Orissa was handed over by the Delhi Emperor in 1765,
and by the Treaty of Salbai in 1782 the Bombay Government
retained the islands of Elephanta and Salsette.</p>

<p>In 1798 Lord Wellesley arrived in India inspired by
Imperial projects which were destined to change the map
of the country. In 1799 Tippoo, Sultan of Mysore, was
defeated and slain at Seringapatam, and the Carnatic or
south-eastern portion of India ruled by the Nawab of
Arcot, as well as the principality of Tanjore, were placed
under British rule. These territories constitute the
greater part of the present Madras Presidency. In 1801
the whole of the tract between the Ganges and Jumna,
known as the Doab, with Rohilkhand, were obtained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
purchase from the Nawab Vizir of Oudh. In 1803, after
the second Mahratta War, Orissa was forfeited to the
British and Berar to the Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1815
the Himalayan States were taken from the Nepalese, in
1817 the Pindaris were crushed in Central India and in
1818, after the third Mahratta War, the Bombay Presidency
was formed. Assam was annexed in 1826, and
Bharatpur taken in 1827.</p>

<p>The extension of postal services over this vast increase
of territory can be traced only by scattered references in
official documents. There was no general postal system
in the country prior to 1837. A few main lines of couriers
connecting the principal towns in the various provinces
with the seat of Government had been established for
the conveyance of Government letters and parcels, but
the use of these mail services by private persons was conceded
only as a privilege. The local posts in districts
between police stations and head-quarters were maintained
by the zemindars or landholders of each district,
and their duties in this respect are laid down in Bengal
Regulation XX of 1817. The postmasters of Presidency
towns exercised the functions of a Postmaster-General in
their own provinces up to 1785, and the Collectors or
district officers were responsible for post office and mail
lines within the limits of their own jurisdictions. There
was no central authority to secure the co-operation of
postal officials in different provinces or to maintain uniformity
of procedure, and the charges for the conveyance
of letters, which, in the absence of postage stamps, were
levied in cash, varied according to weight and distance.
Thus the cost of conveyance of a letter from Calcutta to
Bombay was one rupee a tola (2/5 oz. approximately), and
from Calcutta to Agra twelve annas a tola. As postal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
officials were inclined to get as much as possible out of
the public, private posts existed everywhere and were able
to compete successfully with the Government services.</p>

<p>The letters of Victor Jacquemont, who travelled in
India in 1830 as Naturalist to the Royal Museum of
Natural History, Paris, throw some light on the working
of the Post Office at the time. The post was carried
altogether by runners, and the travellers' bungalows on
the various routes were under the Post Office. According
to Jacquemont, three servants were attached by the
postal administration to each bungalow, to look after the
comforts of travellers and to supply them with palanquin
bearers. Letters seem to have had very uncertain careers.
The usual time from France to Upper India was eight
months. Jacquemont had no great faith in the post. On
several occasions he trusts his letters to the Almighty to
watch over during their travels.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of Act XVII of 1837 a public
post was established and Government assumed the exclusive
right to convey letters for hire in the territories
of the East India Company. Uniformity was attempted
by the issue to all post offices of elaborate polymetrical
tables, which fixed the charges to be levied on the principal
routes. The Act of 1837 caused a great deal of
dissatisfaction owing to the abolition of many private and
well-organized services which were not at once replaced,
or else replaced very inefficiently, by Government services.
The landholders had to pay a local cess to maintain the
District Posts, and they felt it a distinct grievance that
they should have to pay for the upkeep of these, as well
as fees for their correspondence, while all official letters
were carried free of charge. An inquiry made by Captain
Taylor of the Bengal Establishment into the working of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the 1837 Act brought many of these grievances to light,
and on his recommendation certain improvements were
made in the interests of the landholders. Thus there
grew up in India a dual system of posts&mdash;on the one
hand, the Imperial Post, which controlled all main routes
and large offices; on the other, the District Post, which
was entirely local and controlled the rural services in each
district. The establishments were quite separate, and
where the two systems came in contact there was often
a great deal of friction.</p>

<p>The principle on which the District Post was based
was the liability of landholders to maintain communications
for Government purposes between the executive
head of a district and his subordinates in outlying places&mdash;a
responsibility which in many instances they were glad
to discharge by a money payment to the magistrate who
undertook the organization of the requisite agency. The
laws under which it was administered were framed with
the object of levying a small cess in each district. This
was used, at the discretion of the magistrate, for the payment
of dak-runners and other persons who conveyed
correspondence between police stations and district officials.
This local post undoubtedly existed from ancient
times, and its maintenance was a liability to which the
landholders had been subject from a period long before
the advent of British rule.</p>

<p>The District Post in India, which was an important,
though not very efficient, auxiliary to the Imperial Post,
thus owed its origin to the need for maintaining the
means of official communication between the head-quarters
of each district and the revenue and police
stations in the interior, where the general wants of the
locality were not such as to call for the provision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Imperial post offices. It consisted of lines of communication
connecting such stations, and was maintained
primarily for the conveyance of official correspondence
in accordance with the requirements of each district, but
subsequently it was also made available for private correspondence.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country the cost of the District
Post lines was met by local cesses specially levied for the
purpose, and in other places it was met from Imperial or
provincial grants as a charge on the general revenues of
the country.</p>

<p>Originally the District Post in India was managed by
district officers or other local officials quite independently
of the Imperial Post, but, in order to increase the
efficiency of the service, Local Governments and Administrations
were asked to transfer the management
to the officers of the Imperial Post Office. The North-Western
Provinces (now United Provinces) Government
was the first to accept the proposal, and the management
of the District Post there was taken over by the
Postmaster-General of the circle in the year 1864. This
arrangement did not constitute an incorporation of the
District Post with the Imperial Post, but merely a
transfer of the management of the former to the officers
of the latter, the financial control of the District
Post remaining as before with the Local Government.
As was anticipated, this measure led to rapid development
of private correspondence, an acceleration of the
speed at which the mails were carried and a marked
improvement in the postal arrangements in the interior
of districts. Consequently the objections which were
at first raised in many quarters were silenced, and the
other Local Governments and Administrations soon fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
into line, so that in the course of the next fourteen
years the management of the whole of the District
Post throughout India was gradually transferred to the
Imperial Post Office.</p>

<p>As the number of Imperial post offices increased the
primary object of the District Post became less important
and its funds were devoted more and more to the extension
of rural delivery and postal facilities in backward
rural tracts. As these tracts developed and the postal
traffic produced sufficient revenue to cover the expenditure
the Imperial Post took them over, and the money
thus set free was used to start offices, lines and rural
messengers in country not yet opened. In this way the
District Post acted the part of pioneer to the Imperial
Post and greatly assisted its progress.</p>

<p>In 1903, in connection with the revision of the Provincial
Settlements, the Government of India decided to
abolish the exceptional arrangement under which, in some
provinces, a portion of the revenue and expenditure in
connection with the District Post was included in the
Provincial accounts. It was ordered that from the commencement
of the new settlements all such receipts and
charges which were then Provincial would be made
Imperial. In accordance with this decision all the District
Post establishments in the Presidencies of Bengal
and Madras and the Province of Assam, which were formerly
paid from Provincial funds, were brought directly
on the general establishment of the Imperial Post Office
with effect from the 1st April, 1904. Two years later the
Government of India decided to take over the remaining
District Post charges in India, and the District Post was
abolished entirely with effect from the 1st April, 1906.
It was at the same time ordered that from that date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
every postal charge would be an Imperial one and that
no postal charges of any description whatsoever might be
incurred from Provincial or Local funds.</p>

<p>In 1850 three Commissioners, Messrs. Courtney,
Forbes and Beadon, were appointed by the Government
of India to inquire into the methods for making the Post
Office more efficient and more conducive to the convenience
of the public than it had been hitherto.</p>

<p>In 1851 the Commissioners, after making exhaustive
inquiries, presented a report which dealt with every
phase of Post Office work, and on this report has been
based the whole fabric of the present administration.
The most important questions discussed were:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The necessity for a uniform rate of postage irrespective
of distance.</p>

<p>(2) The need for prepayment of postage by means of
adhesive postage stamps.</p>

<p>(3) The fixing of a low initial rate of postage.</p>

<p>(4) The abolition of franking.</p>

<p>(5) The formation of the Post Office as an Imperial

<p>The report of the Commissioners is contained in a
bulky volume of some six hundred pages, of which the
preamble is most interesting and throws a great deal of
light on the domestic history of India in the first half of
the nineteenth century. The reforms are based throughout
on the principle that the Post Office is to be maintained
for the benefit of the people of India and not for
the purposes of swelling the revenues, and it is greatly
to the credit of the Government of India that in all times
of stress and strain, as well as in times of prosperity, they
have loyally observed this principle, although there have
been many temptations to act contrary to it.</p>

<p>With the advance of postal administration in India in
the last sixty years we can hardly realize the difficulties
that had to be faced in 1851. One of the chief ones was
the poverty of the great bulk of the population, many of
whom could ill afford to spend even the smallest Indian
coin, namely, one pie, a twelfth part of a penny, on anything
that was not necessary for their own sustenance.</p>

<p>In dealing with this matter the following remarks of
the Commissioners are very interesting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In considering what plan of postage is best suited to
the circumstances of India, and most likely to conduce to
the convenience of the public, the social and commercial
advancement of the country, and the ultimate financial
advantage of the department, the difference between the
circumstances of the European and native portion of the
community must be distinctly borne in mind. It must
be remembered that the former are very few in number,
but, generally speaking, well educated and in affluent circumstances;
that they are accustomed and inclined to
social correspondence, for which, from being collected at
particular stations throughout the country, they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>great facilities; and are comparatively little hindered
from indulging in it by the expense which it entails on
them, being for the most part regardless of the pecuniary
advantage which they might derive from a more careful
attention to the weight of their letters. The natives, on
the other hand, are incalculably more numerous than
their European fellow-subjects. Upon the moderate
assumption that there are two thousand natives for every
European, and that not more than 1 per cent of the
former can read and write, still there must be twenty
natives for every European who can correspond by the
post without assistance, provided that the means of paying
postage are within their reach, and that the receipt
and delivery of their letters are facilitated. But they are
poor, and, though well inclined to correspond, greatly
prevented from doing so by the present high rates of
postage to distant stations, and still more by the distance
which separates the mass of them from the nearest post
office, and by the consequent trouble, expense, uncertainty
and perhaps loss, which the receipt and despatch
of their letters involve. The occupations in which large
numbers of natives are engaged connected with the internal
trade of the country are such as naturally to render
their correspondence on matters of business far more extensive
than that of Europeans, the greater part of the
latter being engaged in the service of Government and
not under the necessity of writing letters except on their
own personal concerns or those of their friends. With
the improvement of the means of communication, extension
of trade and the gradual spread of knowledge
throughout the country, the instructed and writing portion
of the native community will continue to bear an
increasing ratio both to the rest of their fellow-countrymen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
men and to the European residents in India, but to the
bulk even of these the amount they can afford to expend
on the postage of their letters must ever be a matter of
strict economical calculation. It may be regarded as certain
that the utmost care will always be observed by the
native community in keeping the weight of their letters
within the minimum chargeable weight; and unless some
considerable reduction is made in the existing rates of
postage to distant places they will continue to resort to
ingenious contrivances for the purpose of saving expenditure
under that head, or avoiding it altogether."</p></blockquote>

<p>The practice of "clubbing" or of enclosing a number
of small letters in one cover addressed to a person who
undertook to deliver them by hand was very common in
India before 1850 and is not unknown at the present time.
When the difference in cost between a single and double
letter was considerable, this practice entailed a great loss
of revenue to the Post Office, and in order to stop it the
Commissioners proposed to make the unit of weight a
quarter of a tola and to charge extra postage for each
quarter tola of weight. The unit finally adopted was half
a tola, as it was thought that Post Office clerks would have
difficulty in detecting such small divisions of weight as a
quarter of a tola. At the same time heavy penalties were
imposed on clubbing, and the practice has gradually
fallen into disuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Uniformity of postage irrespective of distance had
many opponents at the time. It was recommended by
the Commissioners on the ground of fairness, simplicity
and the facilities it gave for the introduction of other
improvements into the department. To use their own
words: "Combined with a low rate of charge, it forms
the conspicuous and chief benefit which the monopoly of
the carriage of letters enables Government to confer
upon the whole body of its subjects, by almost annihilating
distance and placing it within the power of every
individual to communicate freely with all parts of the
Empire. It makes the Post Office what under any other
system it never can be&mdash;the unrestricted means of diffusing
knowledge, extending commerce and promoting in
every way the social and intellectual improvement of the
people. It is no longer an experiment, having been introduced
with eminent success into the United Kingdom as
well as into the United States of America, France, Spain
and Russia."</p>

<p>There was a strong body of opinion in favour of the
compulsory prepayment of postage in all cases on the
ground that in India it was most difficult to collect the
postage due on bearing letters; in fact, the letters were
usually sent open, read by the addressees and then refused,
so that both the sender and recipient got all they wanted
out of the Post Office for nothing. However, wiser
counsels prevailed. It was recognized that compulsory
prepayment might mean great hardship in many cases,
and the English system of charging double postage on
unpaid articles was adopted.</p>

<p>These few extracts are sufficient to show the fine spirit
that pervaded the work of the Commissioners. They
were true Imperialists and never took the petty view, but
adhered to the maxim of the greatest benefit to the
greatest number. Their names are forgotten, but the
result of their labours has remained in the fine organization
now known as the Post Office of India.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

EARLY POSTAL REGULATIONS</h2>


<p>Act XVII of 1837, the earliest enactment
establishing a proper postal system in India,
repealed Bombay Regulation XI of 1830
which declared all private dawks within the
Bombay Presidency to be illegal. It conferred the
exclusive right of carrying post for hire on the Governor-General
in Council and fixed the penalty for evasion of
this order at Rs.50 for each letter. The Bhangy Post
was opened to the public with the condition that letters
exceeding 12 tolas must be sent by bhangy wherever
such a line existed. The Governor-General in Council
was authorized to frame a scale of distances, according
to which the rates for inland postage should be calculated
and also to fix the rates for steamer and ship postage.
Strict regulations were laid down compelling commanders
of vessels to deliver all letters on board to the
post office at each port of call, also to receive all letters
handed over to them by the post office at any port.
The commander of the vessel received one anna for each
letter delivered or received.</p>

<p>We find the origin of the Dead Letter Office in Sections
25 to 27 of the Act. Unclaimed letters after lying for
three months at any post office were to be sent to the
General Post Office of the Presidency, and at intervals,
not exceeding three months, lists of such unclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
letters and packets were to be published in the Official
Gazette, When letters and packets lay unclaimed for a
period of eighteen months at the General Post Office,
the Postmaster-General was authorized to open them
and pay any valuable property found therein into the
Government Treasury for the benefit of the party
having a right to it. After a further period of twelve
months unclaimed letters were to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The Governor-General in Council had the power to
grant to any person the privilege of sending and receiving
all letters and packets by letter post free of postage, and of
sending and receiving letters and packets by bhangy on
the public service free of postage. This privilege was
granted to the following persons:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State.</p>

<p>The President and Secretaries of the Board of Control.</p>

<p>The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Directors of
the East India Company.</p>

<p>The Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Assistant
Secretary at the East India House.</p>

<p>The Governor-General.</p>

<p>The Governors of Bengal, Madras and Bombay.</p>

<p>The Governor of Ceylon.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces.</p>

<p>Single postage to be added for each additional tola or
part thereof.</p>

<p>Special rates for distance were also fixed for:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1)  Law papers, Accounts and Vouchers attested as
such, with the full signature of the sender.</p>

<p>(2)  Newspapers, Pamphlets and other printed or
engrossed papers, packed in short covers open
at each end, imported matter being charged at
a cheaper rate than matter printed in India.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Parcels were limited to 600 tolas (15 lbs.) in weight,
and the rate was 6 annas for 50 tolas (20 oz.) for 50
miles, then 3 annas for every additional 50 tolas or part
thereof for every 50 miles up to 300 miles, after which
3 annas was charged for each 50 tolas for every additional
100 miles up to 1000 miles. For 1200 miles the rate was
Rs.2 as.13 for every 50 tolas, and for 1400 miles and
upwards Rs.3.</p>

<p>By Act XX of 1838 the weight of letters and packets
which could be carried by a road on which there was no
bhangy post was raised from 12 to 30 tolas, and the
postmaster was allowed to use his discretion in forwarding
packets exceeding 30 tolas. It was also enacted that "all
fines incurred under Post Office Acts shall be demanded
by notice from Postmasters-General or from any Postmaster,
and if not paid shall be levied together with
costs on goods and chattels. If no goods are forthcoming
the offender may be committed to prison for
twenty-two calendar months unless the fines, etc., are
sooner paid." Postmasters were authorized to detain
any letter in respect of which any party was liable to a
fine.</p>

<p>Act XVII of 1839 empowered the Governor-General
in Council to alter postage duties as fixed by Sections 6
and 14 of the Act, but not to increase them.</p>

<p>The fact that postage rates were fixed with respect
to distances in 1837 is not a matter for surprise when the
state of Indian roads at the time is considered. In 1833,
Shore, in his <i>Notes on Indian Affairs</i>, describes the main
road between Calcutta and Benares as no better than a
cart-track, and says that the only road worthy of the
name in India is that between Calcutta and Barrackpore.
Nor was it until 1854, with the abolition of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Military Boards and the establishment of the Public
Works Department, that the art of road-making began
to improve. It will thus be understood that in 1837
the maintenance of postal lines was a real difficulty. All
mail matter had to be conveyed by runners, and a slight
extra weight entailed a considerable extra cost. With
the introduction of railways in 1852 and good metalled
roads, upon which light wheeled carriages could be used
for the conveyance of mails and passengers over long
distances, a complete change in postal administration
was effected, and it was no longer necessary to vary the
rates for letters according to distance.</p>

<p>With all the advance made in postal legislation and
the regulation of rates there was not yet any Controlling
Head. The Post Office was managed by Postmasters-General
who were also postmasters in the Presidency
Towns, while Collectors of Districts had charge of
post offices upcountry. Receipts were still granted for
every article received for despatch, and in the Bombay
Presidency the addresses of all articles were entered in
lists known as puttees; these were given to the postmen
who brought back the addressees' signatures on them.
The addresses upon all articles passing in transit through
the Post Office were also recorded; bags were not used,
only packets of paper or cloth.</p>

<p>The English Mail at this time was received once a
month and, since not more than 200 lbs. weight of mails
could be conveyed along the Bombay-Calcutta line in
one day, a week was often required for its disposal.
Originally the opium merchants had their own lines,
and on these being stopped they used to send private
expresses by the Government dawk, which was a great
source of revenue to the Post Office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Act XVII of 1854 marks the commencement of the
organization of the Indian Post Office upon its present
footing. According to its provisions the whole department
was placed under the control of a Director-General;
the office of Postmaster-General was separated from that
of Presidency Postmaster; Postmasters-General were
appointed for the direct administration and supervision
of the postal services in the larger provinces and Deputy
Postmasters-General, at first designated Chief Inspectors,
were appointed to the less important provinces and the
principal Political Agencies. Postage stamps were first
introduced in 1854 and rates were fixed for the conveyance
of letters irrespective of distance.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In this Act the postal monopoly of the East India
Company was again laid down, and the three exceptions
to that monopoly were legalized, namely (1) letters sent
by a private friend to be delivered on his way or journey
to a person, without any hire or reward for such service;
(2) letters solely concerning the affairs of the sender
or receiver thereof sent by a messenger on purpose;
(3) letters solely concerning goods or other property
sent by land or sea, to be delivered with such goods or
property without any hire or reward for carrying the
same.</p>

<p>It was important to include these exceptions in the
Act, as under the Post Office Act of 1837 there was
nothing to prevent a man who sent a letter to his
friend by messenger incurring a penalty of Rs.50, a fine
to which both the messenger and recipient were equally
liable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>The great advance made in 1854 was the introduction
of postage stamps and the fixing of postage rates for
letters irrespective of distance.</p>

<p>The rates were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On every letter not exceeding &frac14; tola in weight, 6
pies.</p>

<p>On every letter exceeding &frac14; tola and not exceeding &frac12;
tola in weight, 1 anna.</p>

<p>On every letter exceeding &frac12; tola and not exceeding 1
tola, 2 annas.</p>

<p>On every letter exceeding 1 tola and not exceeding 1&frac12;
tolas in weight, 3 annas.</p>

<p>On every letter exceeding 1&frac12; tolas and not exceeding
2 tolas in weight, 4 annas.</p>

<p>And for every tola in weight above 2 tolas, 2 additional
annas.</p></blockquote>

<p>With respect to newspapers and engraved papers a
distinction, similar to that laid down in the Act of 1837,
was made between imported and locally produced matter.
The former was charged with 2 annas for every 6 tolas
or part thereof; the latter was charged at the following
rates:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Two annas for a weight not exceeding 3&frac12; tolas.</p>

<p>Four annas for a weight not exceeding 6 tolas, and 2
annas for every additional 3 tolas above 6 tolas.</p></blockquote>

<p>This difference in postage encouraged the circulation
of newspapers and printed matter imported from England,
but the high internal rates must have greatly
hampered the postal circulation of journals printed in
India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Reduced rates, but still varying with distance, were
laid down for Bhangy Post according to the following
scale:&mdash;</p>

<p>The postage on bhangy parcels was calculated by the
most elaborate Polymetrical Tables which were supplied
to all post offices in English and Vernacular. Many a
grievous complaint was laid by members of the public
against the strange methods employed by the Post
Office in calculating the distance between two places.
The sender of a parcel naturally considered that he
should pay for the shortest distance between the place of
despatch and the place of receipt, but not so the Post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Office. It decided that the "postal route," however
circuitous, was the one by which postage should be
calculated.</p>

<p>Letters were ordinarily limited to 12 tolas in weight,
but by Act XX of 1838 the weight had been raised to 30
tolas upon lines where no bhangy post existed; this limit
was now raised to 40 tolas (1 lb.) and, where both a
bhangy and letter post were conveyed in the same
carriage, a special prohibition was made that letters or
packets of newspapers of less than 12 tolas weight must
not be sent by bhangy post under penalty of a fine of
Rs.50 for each offence. This clause was evidently
introduced on account of the charge made by the
railway companies for the carriage of bhangy parcels.</p>

<p>The 600 tola limit for parcels was continued except in
special cases which were laid down by the Governor-General
in Council, but in no circumstances was the
weight of any parcel to exceed 2000 tolas (50 lbs.).
Ship postage was levied on parcels, when conveyed by
the East India Company's post by sea, at the rate of
8 annas for each 100 tolas. When any parcel had to be
conveyed by bhangy as well as by sea, this postage was
levied in addition to bhangy postage. Letters and
newspapers for Ceylon or any place where no postal
communication was established by the East India Company
were dealt with as unclaimed, unless the full
postage was prepaid by means of postage stamps.</p>

<p>With the introduction of postage stamps we now find
the first regulations for encouraging the prepayment of
postal articles. In Section 20 it is laid down that, where
the East India Company have a postal communication,
double postage shall be charged on unstamped letters at
the time of delivery, and in the case of insufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
stamped letters double the deficiency. This rule did
not apply to newspapers or other printed matter, but in
order to compel the public to use the new postage stamps,
post offices were forbidden to accept money in prepayment
of any postal articles except parcels. Redirected letters
were charged with postage at prepaid rates, and a penalty
of Rs.200 was imposed for sending "any explosive or
other dangerous material or substance by post."</p>

<p>Rules were drawn up for the use and sale of postage
stamps, vendors were appointed, and heavy penalties
were exacted from vendors who failed to comply with
the regulations. Registration of any article was allowed
upon payment of a fee of 4 annas which entitled the
sender to a receipt, but, strange to say, the registration
fee had to be paid in cash, stamps not being recognized
in payment.</p>

<p>The clauses of Act XVII of 1837 regarding the obligations
of commanders of vessels were renewed, and also
the clauses dealing with unclaimed and refused articles.
The privilege of free postage was entirely abolished, but
the letters and packets sent on the public service by
certain officials were still carried under frank. The
postage due on such articles was charged to the several
public departments concerned. This measure led to
wanton extravagance in the matter of official postage, no
care was taken to economize either in the number or the
size of "public service" articles and various abuses of
franking occurred. The list of officers authorized to
frank became so large that the Post Office could not
exercise any proper check, and the difficulty of accounting
in connection with the postage due was
enormous. The first restriction was placed on franking
in 1866 when the use of service stamps was made compulsory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
on all letters passing outside the Presidency
towns or limits of the district in which they were
posted, and in 1873 all franking privileges were abolished.</p>

<p>In Section 48 of the Act the duty of the Post Office
to abide by the Customs regulations is insisted upon.
Officers in charge of post offices were bound to detain
articles suspected of containing anything contraband,
and they could refuse to forward any parcel or packet
addressed to a foreign post, unless it was accompanied
by a Customs' House Pass. A long list of penalties, most
of which exist at the present day, was drawn up for
offences and misdemeanours committed by postal officials.
Informers were encouraged by being allowed to receive
half of every fine imposed, but no proceedings could be
taken against any one under this Act without an order
in writing from Government, the Director-General or
a Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>In 1854 Mr. Riddell was appointed the first Director-General
of the Post Office, and he compiled the first
Manual of Rules to be observed by the whole Department.
At this time there were 201 head-quarter offices
and 451 minor offices in India, but every office kept its
own accounts separately and submitted them direct to
the Audit Office which was part of the Accountant
General's Office. It was not until 1861 that postal
accounts were removed from the Civil auditors and
handed over to an officer known as the "Compiler of
Post Office Accounts" and not until 1866-7 that the distinction
between Head and Branch offices was made for
account purposes.</p>

<p>The Manual of 1854 made no proper arrangement for
sorting offices, it only provided for mails being received
<i>en masse</i> and for their distribution afterwards to peons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and into the "thana" and forwarding boxes. Every
post office upon a line had to make up a separate mail
packet for every office in advance, and it received one
from every office in rear, a most cumbersome proceeding,
which was put a stop to in 1860, when long detentions
were made at certain large stations upon the main
routes for the purpose of sorting the mails. Paid letters
were impressed with a red date-stamp to distinguish
them from unpaid, which bore a black date-stamp.
Letters for foreign countries were sent with steamer
postage invoices (chalans) to the different Presidency
towns. Prepayment of articles sent to England via
Marseilles, for which Brindisi was substituted in 1870,
was not possible, nor could letters for countries like the
United States be prepaid.</p>

<p>It seems hardly credible that in 1854 one of the
longest chapters of the Manual was devoted to an
elaborate system of fining, under which different offices
claimed fines from one another for bad work brought
to light by them. The official who detected the finable
offence was allowed to keep the amount of the fine
subject to a deduction of 10 per cent, which was remitted
to the Postmaster-General's office to cover the
cost of printing Fine Statements, Bills, etc. A regular
schedule of offences with the fine allotted for each was
drawn up; for instance, the missending of a mail bag
was assessed at Rs.3, while the missending of a parcel or
packet cost 8 annas. Naturally there was great energy
expended in detecting offences for which fines were imposed,
and the result was an enormous amount of
correspondence and bitter recrimination between offices.
This vicious practice continued for many years and was
not finally put a stop to until 1880.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now ordered that registration upon letters, the
fee for which was still fixed at 4 annas, should be prepaid
in postage stamps. The penal clauses relating to
counterfeiting stamps had been included in the Indian
Penal Code, Act XLV of 1860, and were therefore
omitted from this Act. The other penal clauses were
practically the same as those that existed in the Act of
1854, and the principle is again laid down of the non-responsibility
of Government for any loss or damage
which may occur in respect of anything entrusted to the
Post Office for conveyance.</p>

<p>From 1866 the work of the Post Office began to develop
enormously, and its functions had to be gradually extended
to meet the growing needs of the public. In
1869 the charge on redirected letters was abolished
and the letter postage rates were further reduced as
follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align="left">For every additional tola or fraction thereof</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The antiquated system of making parcel post rates
vary with distance could no longer be maintained, and
in 1871 a system of rates which varied with weight,
irrespective of distance, was introduced. A parcel post
service was established between India and England in
1873, but the collection and distribution of parcels were
at first effected through the agency of the Peninsular
and Oriental Steamship Company, and it was not until
1885 that the Post Offices of both countries undertook
the management of the parcel post. In 1873 special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
postage rates were introduced for official articles,
namely:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Not exceeding &frac12; tola</td><td align="right">&frac12;</td><td align="center">anna.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Not exceeding 10 tolas</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Not exceeding 20 tolas</td><td align="right">5</td><td align="center">annas.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Not exceeding 30 tolas</td><td align="right">10</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Every additional 10 tolas</td><td align="right">5</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>At the same time it was laid down that official covers
from Government offices should be prepaid by means of
service postage stamps.</p>

<p>Under the provision of the Act of Parliament (III-IV
Vict. Cap. 69) soldiers and seamen were allowed the
privilege of sending letters not exceeding half an ounce
in weight at the rate of 1d. for each letter. This rate was
introduced into India in 1854, and 8 pies was reckoned
the equivalent of 1d. In 1874 the postage on such letters
was fixed at 9 pies for half an ounce owing to the increase
in the rate of exchange. In 1899 the Imperial Penny
Postage scheme was introduced, by which the initial
rate of postage to the United Kingdom and to certain
British colonies and possessions was fixed at 1 anna for a
letter not exceeding half an ounce in weight, so that the
privilege enjoyed by soldiers and seamen was no longer
of any advantage, and when in 1907 the initial rate under
the Imperial Penny Postage Scheme was raised from
half an ounce to 1 ounce there was no further object
in retaining this special concession.</p>

<p>In 1877 the Value-Payable or Cash on Delivery system
was introduced, and in 1878 the Post Office undertook
the insurance of letters and parcels. At first there was
no limit to the amount for which an article could be
insured, until a claim for the contents of a parcel insured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
for Rs.60,000 showed the enormous liabilities which the
Department might incur under this system. Accordingly,
in 1890 the limit was fixed at Rs.1000, but was raised in
1898 to Rs.2000, and the procedure was greatly simplified.
The insurance fee was originally fixed at one-half per
cent, which was subsequently reduced to a quarter, and
in 1905 to one-eighth per cent.</p>

<p>Previous to 1880 the money order work of the country
was carried on by the Government Treasuries, and the
procedure was rather cumbersome; in that year it was
handed over to the Post Office, with the result that in a
few months the number of money orders issued and paid
quadrupled. The extent to which money order business
has increased may be gauged from the fact that the value
of inland money orders in 1880-81 was 45 millions, and
in 1917-18 it had increased to over 617 millions of
rupees.</p>

<p>In 1870 Government Savings Banks were first established
in India in connection with District Treasuries,
and in 1882 permission was given to open savings bank
accounts at post offices, but the management and control
of the funds still remained with the Treasuries. In 1885
all savings banks at Treasuries were closed and the business
was transferred entirely to the Post Office. The
general development of this branch will be treated of
in the chapter on Savings Banks, but, as an example of
the growth of business, the figures of 1882-83 and of
1913-14 are remarkable. In 1882-83 there were 39,121
depositors with a balance of Rs.27,96,730; in 1913-14
there were 1,638,725 depositors with a balance of
Rs.23,16,75,467.</p>

<p>In 1883 combined post and telegraph offices were introduced,
and it is no exaggeration to say that these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
solely responsible for the extension of telegraph facilities
to the smaller markets and rural tracts of India. In 1884
the sale of British postal orders was authorized, and the
same year marks the introduction of Postal Life Insurance,
a measure at first confined to servants of the Department
but afterwards extended to all Government servants.
In 1890, at the request of the military authorities,
the Post Office undertook the payment of military pensioners
in the Punjab.</p>

<p>In this way the Department has grown. From being a
mere agency for the carriage of correspondence and
parcels in 1866, the Post Office has now become the poor
man's bank; it does an enormous value-payable and
money order business; it is an important insurance
agency and pension paymaster, and to such an extent
have postage rates been reduced in India that it would
be hard to find a man who could not afford to communicate
by post with his friends.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the Post Office Act of 1866 was quite
unsuited to modern needs, and Act VI of 1898 was
framed to deal with the new requirements of postal work.
The 1866 Act was amended by Act III of 1882, which
authorized any officer of the Post Office empowered in
this behalf by the Governor-General in Council to search
for newspapers regarding which a notification had been
published under the Sea Customs Act. By Act III of
1895 powers were provided in accordance with the general
policy of the Postal Union for dealing with fictitious or
previously used postage stamps of other countries found
on articles received from abroad, and by Act XVI of 1896
the Post Office was authorized to collect Customs duty
paid in advance in the same manner as postage under the
Act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Act VI of 1898 is to a great extent an Enabling Act
which reserves to Government the power of dealing by
rule with numerous questions of postal practice and procedure
affecting the public. For the first time legal
recognition was given to registered newspapers, and the
Governor-General in Council was empowered to make
rules for their registration in the offices of Postmasters-General.
The acceptance of the official marks of the Post
Office on postal articles as prima facie evidence that they
have been refused, that the addressee cannot be found, or
that any sum is due on them, was a principle taken from
the English Law.</p>

<p>Section 20 of the Act was quite new and prohibits the
sending by post of indecent or obscene articles, and the
tendency of the age is shown by the first mention in this
clause of the word "sedition" in connection with postal
articles. "Articles having thereon or on the cover thereof
any words, marks or designs of an indecent, obscene, seditious,
defamatory or grossly offensive character" were
prohibited from being sent by post. The wording of this
section is interesting owing to the difficulty of interpreting
the meaning of the word "thereon"; it would
almost seem that the framers of the Act wished to wrap
this clause in ambiguity. In Section 22 the important
principle of the English Law is laid down that the Post
Office is not bound to send parcels and packets along with
the letter mail, but may detain them as long as is necessary.
By Section 25 special power is given to search for
goods notified under the Sea Customs Act, and in Section
26, the Public Emergency section, "The Governor-General
in Council, or a Local Government, or any officer
specially authorized in this behalf by the Governor-General
in Council, may, by an order in writing, direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that any postal article or class or description of postal
articles in course of transmission by post shall be intercepted
or detained." Had the framers of this Act any
idea of the extent to which this power would have to be
used they might have expressed themselves in greater
detail.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Sections 30 to 36 and 43 to 48 of the Act deal
with the power of the Governor-General in Council to
make rules for the insurance of postal articles and the
transmission of value-payable articles and money orders
by post.</p>

<p>To judge from the large number of additional penalty
clauses introduced into this Act, postal crime seems to
have grown side by side with postal development. Every
possible misdemeanour and fraud is visited with appropriate
punishment; not even the mail runner who fails
in his duty to appear at the time he is required can escape,
while the postman who makes a false entry in his book to
show that he has been visiting a certain village, when all
the time he has been loitering in a neighbouring bazaar,
renders himself liable to six months' imprisonment or a
fine of one hundred rupees. Sections 62 and 63 are taken
from the English Post Office Protection Act, 1884, and
impose penalties for injuring the contents of any letter-box
or for disfiguring any post office or letter-box. To
prevent hasty and ill-considered prosecutions, it was laid
down in Section 72 that no Court should take cognizance
of any offence under the Act, except with the previous
sanction or on the complaint of the Director-General of
the Post Office or of a Postmaster-General.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1898 postage rates on letters were reduced to the
following scale:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<tr><td align="left">For every additional 1&frac12; tolas or fraction thereof</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">anna.</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>The postage on newspapers was fixed at:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Not exceeding 4 tolas</td><td align="right">&frac14;</td><td align="center">anna.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">For every additional 20 tolas or part thereof</td><td align="right">&frac12;</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In 1905 a still further reduction in letter postage was
made, namely:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Not exceeding &frac34; tola</td><td align="center">&frac12;</td><td align="center">anna.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&frac12; tolas</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="center">annas.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">For every additional 1&frac12; tolas or fraction thereof</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">anna.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In 1907, after a long discussion, it was decided to make
the Indian anna rate approximate to the English penny
rate. The British Post Office had decided to carry 4
ounces for one penny, and as an ounce is roughly 2&frac12; tolas
the weight that could be sent for an anna was increased
from 1&frac12; to 10 tolas. The &frac34; tolas for &frac12; anna was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
properly considered absurd, and the weight was raised to
1 tola. The rates as revised in 1907 were:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Not exceeding 1 tola</td><td align="right">&frac12;</td><td align="center">anna.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 tolas</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">For every additional 10 tolas or fraction thereof</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="center">anna.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This was a sweeping measure which mainly benefited
that portion of the community which could best afford
to pay high rates of postage, and the argument for making
the anna rate correspond to the penny rate in England left
out of account the very important fact that in England
the minimum rate for letters was a penny, whereas in
India it is half that amount. It is difficult to estimate
what the loss to the Post Office must have been, but when
one considers that a letter of 10 tolas, which under the
previous rates would have had to bear 7 annas postage,
could be sent for 1 anna it will be understood that the
loss was considerable. The measure was also one that
affected the Post Office in two ways, since less revenue
was received in postage stamps and the increased number
of bulky letters necessitated a larger carrying staff. Despite
the admitted cheapness of postage in India, some
short-sighted agitators cry out for a &frac14; anna letter rate;
but the Post Office can well afford to disregard their murmurings
and may congratulate itself on having made its
services accessible to even the very poorest member of the
community.</p>

<p>By Act III of 1912 the Indian Post Office Act of 1898
was further amended, and special rules were made to
protect postmasters who had to search or detain articles
passing through the post. The public who use the value-payable
system have been protected from fraudulent
traders by a section which provides for the retention and
repayment to the addressee, in cases of fraud, of money
recovered on the delivery of any value-payable postal
article; at the same time the Post Office is authorized
to levy a fee before making any inquiry into complaints
of this kind.</p>

<p>Since the Great War broke out in 1914 it has been
found necessary to increase inland postage rates for both
letters and parcels. In 1918 the letter rates were fixed
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Many complaints were received that the parcel rates
were excessive and injuring the fruit trade and other local
industries, so that with effect from the 1st June, 1919,
the rates were reduced to 3 annas for every 40 tolas up
to 440 tolas, the minimum of 2 annas for 20 tolas remaining
the same.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

PARCEL POST</h2>


<p>The parcel post in India has its origin in the
old "Bhangy Post," a name derived from the
bamboo stick or bhangy which an Indian
carrier balances on his shoulder with the
weights slung at each end. The Bhangy Post was first
used solely for the conveyance of official records and
articles sent on Government service, and the limit of
weight was 600 tolas (15 lbs.). In 1854 a regular Bhangy
Post was established and opened to the public. The rates
varied with weight and distance according to the scale
laid down in the Post Office Act of 1854. Where communication
by rail existed, the practice was to hand over
bhangy parcels to the railway at the latter's risk and to
demand their conveyance to destination free of charge.
This procedure led to a series of those acrimonious disputes
which are so characteristic of the early relations
between the Post Office and the railway companies. The
contention of the Post Office was that the bhangy mail
formed part of the regular mail which the railway was
bound by law to carry free of charge. The East India
Railway, which took up the cudgels on the other side,
denied this contention and insisted upon charging for
parcels as goods sent by passenger train. Finally, after
much wrangling, the matter was settled by Government
in 1855, when it was decided that service bhangy parcels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
should be carried free and that the rate for non-service
parcels should be fixed at 1/3 anna per maund (80 lbs.) per
mile, which was the existing rate for passengers' luggage.
At the same time the Post Office was directed to withdraw
from the carrier traffic wherever the railway could
supply its place, and post offices were forbidden to accept
non-service bhangy parcels for places situated on railway
lines.</p>

<p>These rules were not very effective, since it was impossible
to distinguish service from non-service parcels or
to ascertain the weight of the latter when they were both
despatched together and lump sum payments were
accepted. The amounts paid show that the traffic cannot
have been very great; for instance, in 1871 the Great
India Peninsula Railway agreed to accept a monthly payment
of Rs.568, the Madras Railway Rs.173 and the
Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway Rs.150,
which was afterwards raised to Rs.400 in 1881. The
whole question was soon merged in that of general haulage
rates for postal vehicles, which is discussed in the
chapter upon the Railway Mail Service.</p>

<p>The statement at the end of this chapter shows the
variation in parcel rates from 1866 to 1919. The first
great step forward in the administration of the parcel post
was in 1871, when rates according to distance were
abolished and a fixed rate of 3 annas for 10 tolas was introduced.
The limits of weight were retained at 600 tolas
for foot lines and 2000 tolas for railway lines, which were
fixed in 1869. In 1895 rates were reduced and registration
for all parcels exceeding 440 tolas in weight was
made compulsory. In 1907, after a strong representation
made by the Railway Conference that the parcel post
was interfering with the railway parcel traffic, the limit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of weight was lowered to 800 tolas (20 lbs.). As a matter
of fact, after a careful inquiry it was found that very few
parcels above this weight were carried by the Post Office
and that these were carried at a loss. In the same year
the rates for small parcels were greatly reduced, with the
result that the total number carried in 1907-8 increased
by over 600,000. The railways did not gain much by the
concession, as the retail dealers adopted the simple device
of packing their goods in smaller bulk, which the low rates
enabled them to do without any appreciable loss.</p>

<p>The development of parcel traffic since 1854 is shown
by the following figures:&mdash;</p>

<tr><td align="left">1917-18</td><td align="right">14,150,948</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The increase in the last few years is little short of marvellous
and is due to the reduction in rates and the
growth of the value-payable or cash on delivery system
so largely adopted by all retail traders, which has diverted
the whole of the light parcel traffic from the railways to
the Post Office.</p>

<p>In 1873 an overland Parcel Post was established between
Great Britain and India through the agency of the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.
The British Post Office had no concern with this arrangement,
and in 1885 a direct exchange, which was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
separate from the P. &amp; O. Company's contract, was introduced
between the two administrations for parcels up
to a limit of seven pounds in weight. In 1897, at the
Universal Postal Congress held at Washington, India
joined the International Parcel Post Union, and since 1899,
when the Acts of the Congress came into force, parcels
can be exchanged with almost any country in the world.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, nothing has affected the parcel
post traffic of the country to such an extent as the
value-payable or cash on delivery system, which was introduced
in 1878 and is now used generally by all retail
firms in India. By this system the Post Office not only
undertakes to deliver a parcel, but also, for a small commission,
to collect the cost of it from the addressee. In
India, where there are few large firms outside the Presidency
towns, the value-payable system has proved an inestimable
convenience to the upcountry purchaser, who
pays the Post Office for his purchases on receipt and is
put to no further trouble. Like everything designed for
the good of mankind, the Value-Payable Post is not altogether
an unmixed blessing, and it is a source of continual
worry to the officials of the Department. The weak
point in the system is that people have to buy articles
without seeing them, and if they are disappointed in their
purchases they are inclined to think that the Post Office
is at fault and to demand their money back. It is customary
in India for certain ladies to dispose of their
garments through the medium of the advertisement
columns of the <i>Pioneer</i>, one of the leading newspapers.
The dresses are always by Paquin and quite new; the hats
are the latest from Paris. This is the seller's point of
view. How different that of the purchaser! As Postmaster-General
I have received many a bitter complaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of the rag which has been received under the name of a
new Paquin gown and for which I apparently was held
personally responsible. "I never imagined that the Post
Office could lend its assistance to such disgraceful swindling,"
once wrote an indignant lady who had suffered in
this way and who was told that the Department could
not possibly adjudicate on the quality of the goods received
by her, that the Department was only in the
position of carriers and that she must settle her dispute
with the sender.</p>

<p>The value-payable system suffers chiefly from the firm
belief in Providence which is so deeply engrained in the
Eastern mind. Although strictly forbidden by the rules
of the Post Office, the small trader sends out numbers of
articles by value-payable post to persons who have not
given any orders for them, trusting that some of them
will be accepted by a confiding public, and, strange to
say, he manages to do a certain amount of business in this
way. On the other hand, many people are quite ready
to order things from shops which they hope to be able
to pay for upon arrival, but, unfortunately for the firms
that supply them, these hopes are often not fulfilled. The
Indian schoolboy, who is very like all other schoolboys in
the world in this respect, is specially tempted by the
flashy catalogues issued by the cheap Calcutta firms, and
when, in the enthusiasm of the moment, he orders a five
rupee watch, it doesn't follow that he has the money or
is even likely to have it; but his self-esteem is satisfied
by the mere issue of the order and, as for his ability to
pay when the time comes, it lies on the knees of the gods.
The result of this trait in Eastern character is that about
20 per cent of the value-payable articles posted are returned
to the senders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Some years ago a firm of box-makers who wanted to
push their business discovered that the value-payable post,
assisted by the national character, provided them with a
royal road to success, and they set to work on the following
lines. They issued a large number of tickets by post,
which were delivered on payment of 1 rupee and 2 annas.
Any person who was innocent enough to accept one of
these found that the ticket was composed of six coupons,
and that if he could induce six of his friends to send the
coupons to the firm and each to receive in return a
similar ticket <i>and pay for it</i>, then he as the original recipient
would be presented with a steel trunk. The
success of this scheme was extraordinary, and every post
office in India was flooded with these coupon tickets.
About 70 per cent were refused, but the firm lost nothing
by this, as it saved them in the matter of trunks, since, if
any one of the coupon holders failed to keep faith with
his friend the bargain was off. The whole business was
a gigantic swindle, and it so offended the Director-General's
sense of morality that he had a regulation passed
to put a stop to any articles being sent by post which contained
"coupons, tickets, certificates or introductions for
the sale of goods on what is known as the snowball
system."</p>

<p>A complete history of the Indian Parcel Post would require
the pen of a military historian. It is a history of
warfare with continuous engagements, sometimes regular
pitched battles with the railways and sometimes small but
sharp skirmishes with irate ladies. The latest foes are the
municipal councils of certain large towns in which the
revenue is raised by an octroi tax upon all imported
articles. Hitherto articles received by post have been
exempt from any tax of this kind, and all attempts made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
by municipalities to be allowed to scrutinize the parcel
post have been strenuously opposed. The thin end of the
wedge has, however, been introduced at Delhi, where lists
of insured parcels are supplied to the municipality, which
makes its own arrangements for ascertaining the contents
from the addressees. The practice is wrong in principle,
because it is a breach of the confidence which the public
place in the Post Office on the understanding that no information
of any kind regarding postal articles is imparted
except to the persons immediately concerned, and any
measure which tends to shake the confidence of the public
in the secrecy of the Department is to be strongly deprecated.
A great deal of fuss was made in Simla some years
ago about this very matter on the ground that the local
traders suffered from people purchasing goods outside the
municipality and getting them in by post. When an inquiry
was held, it was found that the large majority of
parcels received by post were addressed to the firms in
the town, a discovery which put a sudden stop to the
agitation. It is very doubtful if the Parcel Post at the
present rates pays the Post Office, and where places are
situated some distance off the line of rail and have to be
reached by foot lines it is quite certain that every parcel
is carried at a loss. Unfortunately these are the very
places where people make the greatest use of the Parcel
Post; the tea planters of Assam, for example, getting
their whisky, jam and other stores in this way from
Calcutta.</p>

<p>A further agitation is now afoot to have the weight of
parcels brought down to eleven pounds, which is the
maximum weight for a foreign parcel and is also the limit
of weight in England. This, on the whole, is as much as
the Post Office can be fairly expected to carry, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
whether the proposal will be adopted remains to be
seen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

THE RAILWAY MAIL SERVICE</h2>


<p>One of the most important branches of the
Post Office is the Railway Mail Service,
which used to be called the Travelling Post
Office. The railways are the arteries through
which the very life-blood of the Department flows, and
it is upon the arrangements for the conveyance of mails
by rail that proper postal administration depends.
Before 1863 the mail bags were carried in the guard's
van if the weight was small, but when the mail was
heavy a separate compartment in charge of a mail guard
was used. As there was no intermediate sorting,
every post office had to make up a packet or bag for
every other post office in front, and these various packets
were received and delivered at each station by the mail
guard. In a short time the number of such packets
became quite unmanageable, and the inconvenience and
delay in disposing of them considerable, so that, in order
to make it possible to sort the mails between North-West
India and Calcutta, long detentions had to be made
at Allahabad, Cawnpore and Benares, otherwise letters
could not possibly be sent direct to their destinations.
In 1860 a solution of the difficulty was proposed by Mr.
Riddell, Director-General of the Post Office, namely,
the establishment of a Travelling Post Office between
Calcutta and Raneegunge, but the Government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
India refused to sanction it. In 1863, however, a sorting
section was established on the Great Indian Peninsula
Railway between Allahabad and Cawnpore, but no
regular service was organized until 1870, when the
frontier Travelling Post Office was introduced under a
Superintendent with his head-quarters at Allahabad. In
1877 the designation of this Officer was altered to Chief
Superintendent, T.P.O., and in 1880 to Inspector-General,
Railway Mail Service. The Inspector-General
worked as an Assistant Director-General in the Direction
until 1890, but in that year he was placed in a much more
independent position as an administrative officer. Owing
to the large increase in the mileage of the Railway Mail
Service it was found impossible for one man to exercise
an efficient control over it, and in 1905 a Deputy Inspector-General
was appointed; but even with his
assistance the work was too heavy, and in 1907 the whole
of India was divided into four circles and each of them
placed under the jurisdiction of an officer designated
Inspector-General, Railway Mail Service and Sorting,
known by the wits of the Department as an Inspector-General
of sorts. The gentlemen with this sesquipedalian
title control the railways or portions of railways in their
own circles. In 1918 their number was reduced to three
by the abolition of the Southern Circle, and their
designation was altered to Deputy Postmaster-General,
Railway Mail Service.</p>

<p>The main conditions under which a railway should
carry mails were laid down in Clause 20 of the contract
made with the East Indian Railway in 1849, and was as
follows: "That the said Railway Company will at all
times during the said determinable term convey on the
said Railway the Government mails and post bags and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the guards and other servants of the Post Office in
charge thereof free of charge." A similar condition
existed in the contract with the Great Indian Peninsula
Railway, but the Companies contended that the conveyance
of mails did not include the haulage of sorting
carriages in which sorters were employed. The Post
Office refused to accept this view and nasty things were
said on both sides. The Post Office seemed to think
that railways had been invented for the conveyance of
mails without any regard to dividends, while the railways
regarded the Post Office as a confounded nuisance and
its officials as unscrupulous thieves. It was finally
settled that two compartments of a second-class carriage
should be set apart and specially fitted for the Travelling
Post Office on ordinary mail trains free of charge. If a
special carriage was required in addition, then the
haulage rate of 1&frac12; annas a mile would be charged, and
the rate for special trains was fixed at Rs.3-8 a mile.
With respect to the cost and maintenance of postal
vehicles it was decided that, if they were paid for by
Government in the first instance, the charge for maintenance
only should be incurred, but, if the Companies
had to bear the cost of construction, then the charge
should include the cost of maintenance, the interest on
capital and the cost of restoring the vehicles when worn
out.</p>

<p>The settlement between the Post Office and the Railways
did not last long. Despite their acquiescence in
the regulations which had been laid down, the Companies
refused to abide by them and repeated demands
were made for the cost of hauling postal vans. On the
Great Indian Peninsula Railway everything possible was
done to hamper the work of the Department, parcel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
bags were deliberately left behind at stations, postal vans
were cut off at way-side places without any warning
and there never was any certainty that the whole mail
would reach its destination. In 1879 the nuisance
became so intolerable that petitions were made by the
public for the interference of Government, and after
some deliberation a settlement was made with this
Railway on the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The Post Office was to pay Rs.6000 a month for
the ordinary services performed for it by the
Railway, and for this payment a large fitted
van with a well and extra vans for weekly
foreign mails would be supplied.</p>

<p>(2) The price for additional reserved accommodation
was raised from 18 to 30 pies a mile on each
vehicle.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1882 the Government of India prescribed definite
sizes for postal vans and called them standard full and
standard half vans, and arrangements were made with
the East Indian and Madras Railways to accept 8 annas
a mile as the haulage of a standard van. Various agreements
were made with the other railways, some of
which claimed payment not for haulage but for the
conveyance of bhangy parcels, and in some cases lump
sum payments were made annually to cover all services.
For instance, the Darjeeling Steam Tramway was given
a fixed sum of Rs.10,260 annually, which represented
exactly the cost of the old tonga line between Siliguri
and Darjeeling.</p>

<p>The question of haulage of postal vans and of payment
for the carriage of mails was finally settled in connection
with State Railways. In 1877 it was ruled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Governor-General in Council that the conveyance of
mails over State Railways should be paid for. The
question was raised with reference to the conveyance of
mails on the Hathras-Muttra (Provincial) Railway, and
it was decided that the actual cost of carrying the mails
on all Imperial and Provincial railways should be borne
by the Post Office. The rules regarding payment on all
State lines, both broad and metre gauge, were:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Eighteen pies per vehicle per mile to be levied in
proportion to the space occupied by the Postal
Department.</p>

<p>(2) For mail bags and parcels sent in luggage vans in
charge of railway guards, the amount to be
paid was fixed at 1&frac12; pies per maund (80 lbs.)
per mile.</p>

<p>(3) Accounts to be settled half-yearly and the space
as well as weight charged to be adjusted for the
six months on the basis of actual space allotted
(as above) and actual weight carried on the
1st June and the 1st December of each year.</p>

<p>(4) All officers and servants of the Postal Department
travelling in the mail compartment to be
carried without passes. All officials of the
Travelling Post Office not travelling in the mail
compartment to be carried free on being
furnished with passes under the revised free
pass rules. All other officers of the Postal
Department to pay usual fares.</p>

<p>(5) A list to be kept of all free passes issued.</p>

<p>(6) These arrangements to have effect from the 1st
April, 1877, and to remain in force until the
1st April, 1884. All claims against the Postal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>Department to be settled in accordance therewith
without delay, and adjusted in the accounts
of the current official year. No arrear adjustment
to be made in respect of any claims other
than those arising out of the vehicle charge at
18 pies a mile.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some misunderstanding seems to have arisen on the
State Railways regarding the half-yearly calculations
mentioned in paragraph 3, and the question of ferry
charges upon Railway steamers was also raised. There
was also a certain amount of disagreement about the
construction and maintenance of Post Office vehicles,
and on the 23rd May, 1884, Government issued a
Resolution to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) That from the 1st April, 1884, and until further
orders the following rules shall determine the
payment for the haulage of Post Office vehicles,
etc., on State Railways, and for the conveyance
of mails by State Railway ferry steamers, and
that they shall be applied to the East Indian
Railway under the terms of Clause 18 of the
Company's contract.</p>

<p>(2) With reference to the ruling laid down by the
Government of India Public Works Department
Circular No. 7R, dated the 3rd April, 1877, that
the actual expenses incurred for the carriage of
mails on all Imperial and Provincial Railways
shall be paid by the Postal Department, the
charges on all State lines, both broad and
metre gauge, for the carriage of mails shall be
based on a fixed rate of 18 pies per vehicle per
mile, and shall be levied in proportion to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>space actually allotted to the Postal Department
on its own requisition.</p>

<p>(3) For mail bags and parcels sent in luggage vans in
charge of Railway guards the amount to be paid
by the Postal Department shall be 1 pie per
maund per mile. Under this rule mails may be
despatched either</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) as a regular daily service according to
lists supplied to the Traffic Managers for each
half-year; or</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) as occasional despatches not provided for
in the list, a voucher being given for each
despatch; occasional despatches should be restricted
to a weight of 5 maunds for each
despatch.</p>

<p>(4) In addition to the above, a charge equal to 4&frac12;
per cent per annum on the original cost shall
be paid by the Postal Department for all vans
or parts of carriages, built or altered on its own
requisition since the 1st January, 1878, for the
exclusive use of the Post Office.</p>

<p>(5) In the event of the mileage run on the requisition
of the Post Office officials by any special postal
vans and compartments specially fitted for
Post Office work (so as to be unuseable with
convenience for ordinary traffic) being in any
half-year greater in one direction than in the
other, the charge for haulage shall be made,
not on actual distance run, but on double the
highest run in one direction. For this purpose
the Railway Administration will keep a register
of the up and down daily mileage of all special
postal vans or compartments as aforesaid, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>this mileage is not to be used as the basis of a
charge against the Postal Department in supersession
of the procedure laid down in paragraph
8 below unless there is a considerable
difference between the requisitioned up and
down mileages.</p>

<p>(6) With respect to the conveyance of mails by State
Railway ferry steamers where the distance
traversed is 10 miles and less, an addition on
account of the ferry should be made to the bill
for railway service, calculated at the same
mileage rate as the railway charge laid down in
paragraph 2, but the addition shall not be less
than 8 annas for each trip across the river.</p>

<p>(7) When the ferry service is over 10 miles and reserved
sorting accommodation is not required
or provided on board, the charge shall be
separately calculated at the rate of 1 pie per
maund per mile. If reserved accommodation
is required, the rate of charge will be the same
as for a whole carriage, viz. 18 pies per mile.</p>

<p>(8) Accounts are to be settled half-yearly, and the
space as well as weight to be paid for shall be
adjusted for the six months on the basis of actual
space allotted (paragraph 2) and actual weight
carried (paragraphs 3(<i>a</i>) and 7) on the 1st June
and the 1st December of each year, or on such
other date as may be mutually agreed upon.
It is to be assumed that the actual service,
inclusive of mileage, rendered on these dates is
constant throughout the six months. Payments
under paragraph 3(<i>b</i>) will be made
monthly on bills supported by vouchers.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Regarding interest on capital outlay (paragraph 4)
and the mileage of special postal vans (paragraph 5), the
accounts should be rendered for the half-year ending
the 31st May and the 30th November. The bills for
the services rendered to the Postal Department by State
Railways should be made out as above, submitted for
acceptance in the months of January and July and
adjusted in the accounts for February and August in
each year, excepting bills for occasional despatches
(paragraph 3<i>b</i>) which will be adjusted in the month after
presentation of the bills.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(9) All officers and servants of the Postal Department
travelling in the Post Office vans or compartments
shall be carried without passes. All
officers of the Railway Mail Service and the
officers and employés named in Government
of India letter No. 2604R of 16th January,
1879, not so travelling will be carried free on
being furnished with passes under the State
Railways Free Pass Rules. All other officers of
the Postal Department will pay the ordinary
fares.</p>

<p>(10) A list shall be kept of all free passes issued and
periodically recorded in the minutes of official
meetings.</p></blockquote>

<p>All the larger railways in their renewed contracts with
Government have agreed to accept these State Railways
Rules for the conveyance of mails.</p>

<p>In 1886 the Government of India Public Works Department
issued the following addenda to the above:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) In addition to the above the Postal Department
shall hereafter pay, in the first instance, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>original cost of building or fitting up all vans or
parts of carriages required for its use as well as
the cost, when no longer required by the Post
Office, of reconverting them for railway purposes.</p>

<p>(2) The Postal Department shall also pay interest at
4&frac12; per cent on the original cost of all vehicles
now in use, built or altered on its own requisition
since the 1st January, 1878, for the exclusive use
of the Post Office until such time as it may desire
to repay the aforesaid original cost.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are the rules that still govern the dealings between
the Post Office and railways, and at the risk of
being wearisome I have quoted them <i>in extenso</i>. In 1910
the Railway Conference Association started an agitation
that the haulage rates paid were insufficient, and that by
comparison with those paid for goods they were performing
the work of the Post Office at a considerable loss.
The result of an inquiry into their demands for an increase
was an offer from the Director-General to increase
the rate on broad-gauge lines to 24 pies a mile and to
retain the existing rate of 18 pies on narrow-gauge lines.
This offer was accepted provisionally by the Railway Conference
Association in 1913, but the narrow-gauge railways
were not very enthusiastic about an arrangement
which put four hundred thousand rupees annually into
the pockets of their colleagues and gave them nothing
but the honour and glory of having deprived the Post
Office of a portion of its earnings.</p>

<p>Until the last few years the Railway Mail Service was
by far the most unpopular branch under the administration
of the Post Office. The pay was bad, the hours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
duty were long, the work was trying and the discomfort
of the old postal vans baffled description. In the hot
weather they were like ovens and, being closed in with
sorting cases, it was difficult to get a through current of
air. The lighting, provided by indifferent oil lamps, was
injurious to the sight and did not lend itself to accurate
sorting. The sorters started life on Rs.15 a month; they
could not ordinarily hope for more than Rs.60 at the end
of thirty years' service, and the result was an inefficient
and discontented body of men with not a small proportion
of rogues. Since the beginning of the present
century the immense importance of the Railway Mail
Service to the proper working of the Department has
been recognized. Salaries have been greatly increased,
and the best sorters are picked for appointments as inspectors
and Assistant Superintendents. The vans have
been improved, and the bogies in which the large sections
work are comparatively comfortable. They are fitted
with electric light and fans, and work is carried on in them
under the most favourable conditions. In the old days
a continuous duty of twelve hours in the train was an
ordinary occurrence, and it is not a matter for surprise
that men, exhausted by hard work and travel in a temperature
of 110 degrees, made absurd mistakes. The
length of the beats has now been reduced, rest houses
have been provided at the out-stations and every man gets
a sufficient time off duty upon his return to head-quarters.
The new conditions have attracted men of much higher
qualifications and position, and it has now been found
possible to entrust the R.M.S. with almost the whole
sorting of the Post Office. In important offices sorting
for the outward mail is usually performed in a mail office
at the railway station, the great advantage being that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
skilled men are employed and that, by concentrating the
work in one place, economy both in staff and bags is
effected. For instance, if the Calcutta G.P.O. and its
sixty-three town sub-offices each perform their own sorting
they must each make up separate bags or bundles for
a large number of important towns and R.M.S. sections
with which they are in postal communication; but if
they despatch their mail to a central sorting office,
that office, as it deals with a far greater number of
articles, will be in a position to make up direct bags for
a very much larger number of places, like Bombay, Cawnpore,
Agra, Lucknow and Delhi, thereby saving labour in
handling and sorting articles in the running sections. It
is an axiom of the Post Office that no work should be
thrown on a running section which can be performed in
a stationary one, the expense being in the ratio of 3 to 1
in staff alone, not to mention the cost of haulage.</p>

<p>Concentration of sorting, although admirable for large
towns, is not without its drawbacks. Where the system
exists, postmasters are no longer answerable for the disposal
of the outward mail, and they are unable to make
any direct inquiry into public complaints regarding the
loss or missending of articles. As all the sorting is thrown
on one mail office, it is necessary for the various post
offices which serve it to close their mails sooner than they
would if direct bags were prepared for the travelling
sections, so that the latest time of posting has to be fixed
at an earlier hour and the public suffer some inconvenience,
especially in places remote from the station. A
certain amount of double handling also occurs in towns
with a large local delivery, in which case the mail has to
be overhauled before despatch in order to pick out the
local articles. Despite these drawbacks, the system is undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
a good one whenever the postings of a number
of offices can be concentrated in one mail office, but in
small towns it is preferable for the post office to do its
own sorting. Supervision is better, and the sorters can
be used for other work. A solution of the difficulty might
be found by placing the control of all the important
through services under one Director of Mails with a few
assistants to help him in supervision, and it has been
suggested that probably the best results would be obtained
if the Postmasters-General were responsible for
both the sorting arrangements and the discipline of the
staff upon all the railways within their circles. The
present system of having different officers in charge of
R.M.S. circles has caused a great deal of correspondence
and not unfrequently means divided counsels. It has
estranged the heads of postal circles from one of the
most important branches of postal work, namely, the
conveyance of mails by railway. At the same time, the
Railway Mail Service work requires expert knowledge,
and it is important that each railway should have to deal
with only one man in the matter of the conveyance of
mails within its system. This could not be done if
Postmasters-General were in charge, as many railways
pass through several postal circles. The question is full
of difficulties, and after careful consideration it has been
decided not to interfere with the existing arrangements,
but to provide a closer co-ordination between the officers
in charge of Railway Mail Service circles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

MONEY ORDERS</h2>


<p>Previous to 1880 the Money Order system of
India was managed by the Government Treasuries.
Bills of Exchange (Hundis) current for
twelve months were issued by one treasury
payable upon another, and as there were only 283 offices
of issue and payment in the country the money order
was not a popular means of remittance&mdash;in fact, it failed
altogether to compete with the remittance of currency
notes by post.</p>

<p>In 1878 Mr. Monteath, Director-General of the Post
Office, proposed to Government to take over the money
order business from the treasuries. He argued that, with
the small number of treasuries and the trouble involved
in reaching one of these every time a money order had
to be sent or paid, the existing system could never become
popular. The Post Office was able to provide 5500
offices of issue and payment, and the number of these
would be always increasing and becoming more accessible
to the people. Mr. Monteath's proposal was strongly
opposed by the Comptroller-General, but was accepted
by Government and sanctioned by the Secretary of State
on the 27th November, 1879.</p>

<p>On the 1st January, 1880, the Post Office took over the
whole management of issue and payment of money orders,
and the audit was performed by the Compiler of Post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Office Accounts. For the purposes of money order work
post offices were classified under four heads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(1) Offices of issue.<br />
(2) Offices of preparation.<br />
(3) Offices of delivery.<br />
(4) Offices of payment.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The office of preparation was always the head office of
the district in which the addressee resided, and its duty
was to prepare the money order in the name of the
payee upon receipt of the intimation from the office of
issue. The procedure was as follows: An application
for a money order was made at the office of issue and,
on payment of the amount with commission, a receipt
was given to the remitter and the application was sent
to the head office of the district in which the payee
resided. This office was called the office of preparation,
and if the payee resided in its delivery area it
would also be both the office of delivery and payment.
If, however, the payee resided at a sub or branch
office, the office of preparation made out a money
order for delivery at such sub or branch office and
for payment at the post office named by the remitter
in his application. It was not necessary for the office of
delivery to be the office of payment; the remitter could
name any office authorized to pay money orders as the
office of payment. Upon receipt of the money order by
the payee an acknowledgment signed by him was sent to
the remitter, and the payee had to make his own arrangements
for cashing his money order at the proper office of
payment.</p>

<p>The commission charged on money orders was accounted
for by postage stamps affixed to the back of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
application by the office of issue, and the rates were as
follows:</p>

<p>Rs.150 was the maximum amount of a money order. Redirection
was permissible, but such redirection did not
affect the original office of payment, and this could only
be altered by the payee signing the order and sending it
to the office of preparation with an application for the
issue of a new order payable to himself or anyone named
by him at some specified office. A new order was issued,
but a second commission was charged for this service.
Money orders lapsed at the end of the month following
that of issue, but were still payable for two months after
lapsing if a second commission was paid; upon the
expiry of that period they were forfeited to Government.</p>

<p>Certain special conditions with respect to money orders
were (1) that not more than four could be issued to the
same person by the same remitter in one day, except
under special permission from the Compiler of Post
Office Accounts, and (2) that under special orders the
issue of money orders could be refused by any post office.
Foreign money orders were granted on the United Kingdom,
Canada, Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg, Heligoland,
the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark and Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The maximum amount was £10, and the rates of commission

<p>For Canada the rates of commission were doubled.</p>

<p>In 1884 the Telegraphic Money Order system was introduced,
with a charge of Rs.2 for the telegram exclusive
of the money order commission upon the amount to be
remitted. The charge was so high that it was thought
safe to allow a money order up to Rs.600 in value to be
sent by this means. The anomaly thus existed of having
Rs.150 as the limit of an ordinary money order and Rs.600
as the limit of a telegraphic money order. The rule prohibiting
more than four money orders daily being sent
by the same remitter to the same payee, besides being
quite unnecessary, proved no safeguard whatsoever. In
actual practice the name of the remitter was not entered
in the money order receipt, so that the post office of issue
had no means of knowing how many money orders were
sent by the same remitter, unless they were all presented
at the same time. There was really no necessity to fix a
low limit to the amount of a money order, as the whole
procedure was quite different from that previously followed
by the treasuries. The old treasury rule was that
the amount of money orders issued in favour of one
person in a district treasury must not exceed Rs.500 in
one day, but then the money order was like a cheque
payable to bearer and the paying treasury had no knowledge
of the time at which it would be presented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The Post Office, on the other hand, carried its own
money orders and, if the office of payment was short of
funds, it could hold back the money order until funds
were obtained, and do so without the knowledge of the
payee. These arguments prevailed, and in 1889 the
restrictions were removed. The maximum value of an
ordinary money order was raised to Rs.600, and no
limit was placed upon the number which could be
issued in favour of any one person. At the same time
the rates were modified as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 1st April, 1902, after a great deal of pressure
from all classes of the community, Government reduced
the commission upon a money order not exceeding Rs.5
to 1 anna.</p>

<p>The extension of the money order system to the
payment of land revenue was first tried in the Benares
Division of the North-West Provinces at the suggestion
of Rai Bahadur Salig Ram, Postmaster-General, in the
year 1884, and proved an immediate success. In eleven
months, 13,914 land revenue money orders were sent,
the gross value of which amounted to Rs.3,35,904. The
system was a great advantage to small proprietors who
lived at a distance from the Government Collecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Stations. They found that the use of the ordinary
money order for payment of revenue dues was not
acceptable to the subordinate revenue officials, who
suffered the loss of considerable perquisites thereby.
Such remittances were generally refused on some pretext
or other, either because they did not contain the correct
amount due or else because the exact particulars required
by the Land Revenue Department were not given on
the money order form. To meet this difficulty a special
form of money order was devised and the co-operation
of District Collectors was invited. In 1886 the system
was extended to the whole North-West Provinces except
Kumaon, and a beginning was also made in ten districts
of Bengal. The action of the Post Office was fully
justified by results, and revenue money orders were
quickly introduced into the Punjab, Central Provinces
and Madras. In Madras they proved a failure, and were
discontinued in 1892 after a three years' trial. The
system was again introduced in 1906, but it still does
not show any great signs of popularity, the figures
for 1917-18 being 10,293 revenue money orders for
Rs.1,29,400.</p>

<p>Rent money orders were first tried in the North-West
Provinces in March, 1886; an experiment was also made
in Bengal in October, 1886, and the system was extended
to the Central Provinces in 1891. Except in parts of
Bengal and the North-West Provinces, now known as the
United Provinces, the payment of rent by money orders
has never been popular, and the reason is not far to
seek. Rent in India is usually in arrears and, whenever a
tenant pays money to a zemindar (landholder), the latter
can credit it against any portion of the arrears that he
thinks fit. With a rent money order, the case is different,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the money order itself and the receipt which has to be
signed by the zemindar indicate exactly the period for
which rent is being paid, and to that period it must be
devoted. This is the ordinary ruling of the rent courts
and does not at all meet the wishes of zemindars who
want to have their tenants in their power. Besides this
important factor, there is the rooted objection of all
subordinates, whether they be government servants or
zemindars' agents, to be deprived of the time-honoured
offerings which all self-respecting tenants should make
to the landlord's servants at the time of paying their
rents, and the appearance of a postman with a sheaf of
money orders, however punctual the payments may be,
is hardly an adequate substitute for the actual attendance
of the tenants themselves.</p>

<p>In 1886 the plan of paying money orders at the
houses of payees was adopted and proved very satisfactory.
India was indebted to Germany for the idea,
which not only conferred a great boon on the public
but tended to reduce the accumulations of cash at post
offices and to accelerate the closure of money order
accounts.</p>

<p>In Appendix "E" is given the number and value of
inland money orders issued in India from 1880-81 to
1917-18, and the steady increase from year to year is a
certain sign of the great public need which the Indian
money order system satisfies, and of the confidence that
is placed in it.</p>

<p>On the 1st October, 1884, the public was given the
opportunity of employing the telegraph for the transmission
of inland money orders, and during the first
six months of the scheme 5788 money orders for
Rs.3,75,000 were issued. The cost of Rs.2 for the telegram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and &frac12; per cent for money order commission was a
decided bar to the popularity of the telegraphic money
order, which at first was chiefly used in Burma and
Madras owing to the isolated positions of those provinces.
In 1887 the Post Office relinquished its commission
on orders for sums not exceeding Rs.10, and the
telegraph charge was reduced to R.1. This led to an
immediate increase of traffic, the number of such orders
in 1887-88 being 45,417 compared with 18,540 in the
previous year, more than half of which were issued
from Burma. In 1917-18 the total number of telegraphic
money orders issued was 875,000 and the value
Rs.6,22,00,000 of which about three-fifths came from
Burma. With the improvements in railway communication
in India which are continually taking place, the
pre-eminence of Burma in the matter of telegraphic
money orders is likely to continue owing to her isolation
and the largely expanding trade of Rangoon.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous swindler was not long in taking
advantage of the telegraphic money order to ply a
profitable trade. His chief resorts are Benares, Rameswaram,
Tripati and the other great places of pilgrimage
in India; his victim is generally some unfortunate
pilgrim, who is only too anxious to meet an obliging
friend willing to act as a guide and adviser in one of the
sacred cities, and the procedure adopted is always the
same. The swindler acts the part of the kind stranger
and finds out all the details of the pilgrim's family. He
then goes to the local post office, represents himself to be
the pilgrim and sends a telegram to his victim's relations
to say that he has lost his money and wants a certain sum
at once. So confiding are the people of India that it is
very seldom that a request of this kind does not meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with an immediate response, and the swindler, by waiting
a couple of days during which he takes good care to
ingratiate himself with the post office officials, walks off
the richer by a considerable amount. The earlier
reports of the Post Office on the telegraphic money
order system abound in cases of the kind, and very
stringent measures were adopted to put a stop to the
practice. Identification of payees by well-known residents
of the neighbourhood was insisted upon, and a
payee of a telegraphic money order had to prove his
claim and give satisfactory evidence of his permanent
address. Despite all precautions, the telegraphic money
order swindler is still common enough and manages to
get away with large sums from time to time.</p>

<p>Probably in no country in the world is the poor man
so dependent upon the Post Office for the transmission
of small sums of money as in India. The average value
of an inland money order in 1917-18 was Rs.18, and it is
not infrequent for amounts as small as Rs.5 to be sent by
telegraphic money order. The reason undoubtedly is
the facility with which payment is made and the absolute
confidence which the Indian villager places in the Post
Office. An Indian coolie in Burma, who has saved a few
hundred rupees and wants to return to his village,
seldom carries the money on his person, and he has a
strange mistrust for banks; they are much too grand
places for him to enter. He usually goes to a post office
and sends to himself a money order addressed to the
post office nearest his own home and then he is satisfied.
It may be months before he turns up to claim the
money, as he frequently gets a job on the way back
or spends some time at a place of pilgrimage, but he
knows that his money is safe enough and he is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
content to use the Post Office as a temporary bank
to the great inconvenience of the Audit Office. It is
not too much to say that the money order system of
India is part and parcel of the life of the people. They
use it to assist their friends and defy their enemies.
They have in that magic slip of paper, the money order
acknowledgment, what they never had before, that
which no number of lying witnesses can disprove,
namely, an indisputable proof of payment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

SAVINGS BANK</h2>


<p>The first Government Savings Banks were
opened at the three Presidency towns of
Calcutta, Madras and Bombay in 1833, 1834
and 1835, respectively. These Banks were
announced as intended for the investment of the savings
of "all classes British and Native," the return of the
deposits with interest being guaranteed by Government.
Between 1863 and 1865 the management of the Savings
Banks was transferred to the Presidency Banks, and each
Presidency framed its own rules. The first deposits
were limited to Rs.500, and upon the balance reaching
this sum it was invested in a Government Loan. The
limit was gradually increased to Rs.3000 with interest
at 4 per cent, but, as it was found that many people
deposited the maximum amount at once, a rule was
brought in prohibiting the deposit of more than Rs.500
a year in any one account.</p>

<p>In 1870 District Savings Banks were instituted in all
parts of India except Calcutta and the Presidencies of
Madras and Bombay. The limits for deposits were fixed
at Rs.500 a year with a total of Rs.3000 and interest at
3&frac34; per cent was fixed. In December, 1879, revised
rules were drawn up for District and other Government
Savings Banks, the most important change being that
the limit of a deposit account was raised to Rs.5000 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
interest was fixed at 4-1/6 per cent. The result of these
rules was to attract to the Savings Banks a large number
of deposits which should have gone to other banks, and
in 1880 the monthly limit of Rs.500 with a maximum of
Rs.3000 was again imposed and interest was reduced to
3&frac34; per cent.</p>

<p>The proposal to establish Post Office Savings Banks
on the lines of those which existed in England met with
great opposition, especially from the Comptroller-General.
The same arguments were brought forward
which the opponents of the Post Office Savings Bank
Bill in England used when Mr. Gladstone managed to
get this wise and beneficial measure through both
Houses in 1861. In 1882 the first Post Office Savings
Banks were opened in every part of India except Calcutta,
Bombay and the head-quarter stations of Madras. In
Madras, savings banks could be opened by the Director-General,
provided they were not within five miles of a
head-quarter station. The immediate consequence of
this measure was an increase in the number of savings
banks in the country from 197 to 4243. The minimum
deposit was fixed at 4 annas, and interest was allowed
at 3 pies a month on every complete sum of Rs.5; it
was also arranged to purchase Government Securities
for depositors. The end of the first year's working
showed 39,121 depositors with a balance of Rs.27,96,796.</p>

<p>On the 1st April, 1886, District Savings Banks were
abolished and the balances transferred to the Post Office,
but the Local Government Savings Banks at Calcutta,
Bombay and Madras remained in the hands of the
Presidency Banks until the 1st October, 1896.</p>

<p>In 1904, when the balance at the credit of depositors
exceeded 130 millions of rupees, the Government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
India began to be rather nervous of being liable to
pay up such a large sum at call without any warning.
A sudden rush of depositors to withdraw their savings
would tax the resources of Government to the utmost
and, in order to afford some protection, a rule was
made that an extra quarter per cent would be paid
upon deposits, which were not liable to withdrawal
until six months' notice had been given. Needless to
say, the bait did not prove attractive. The additional
interest meant practically nothing to small depositors
and was poor compensation to large depositors for
the inconvenience of having their money tied up for
six months. What the measure did involve was a
great increase of work and account-keeping for little
or no purpose, as the number of accounts subject
to six months' notice of withdrawal never exceeded
3 per cent of the total. These accounts were abolished
in 1908 and, although the Government of India does
not keep any special reserve against the balance in the
Post Office Savings Bank, the depositor has the satisfaction
of knowing that his deposit is guaranteed by the
whole revenue of the country.</p>

<p>The history of the Post Office Savings Bank in India
is rather monotonous. With a single exception it has
been one of continual prosperity and expansion from
1882, the year of its commencement, to 1914. The
balance on the 31st March, 1914, was over 231 million
rupees, and, as the money belongs very largely to small
depositors, who can demand immediate payment, the
bank is placed in a very responsible position towards
the public. It will, therefore, be of advantage to
examine the political and economic crises which have
occurred in this period, and how they have affected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
small depositors' confidence in the Government of
India.</p>

<p>In Appendix D is given the number of accounts and
the balance year by year from 1882 to 1914, which
shows that in no year have the accounts failed to increase
in number and only in 1897-8 has the balance at the
credit of depositors declined. Yet during this period
three important crises occurred. The first was in 1885,
and was known as the Russian Scare, the second in
1896-7 when India was visited by the worst famine on
record, and the third in 1907-8 when a great wave of
sedition and discontent spread over the country.</p>

<p>Two of these crises were political and one economic,
and it is a remarkable fact that the effect of the former
two was felt almost entirely, and of the latter very
largely, in the Bombay Presidency. This circumstance
goes to prove that the inhabitants of Bombay are more
in touch with the affairs of the world than those in other
parts of India.</p>

<p>The Russian Scare of 1885, culminating in the
"Penjdeh Affair," led to very heavy withdrawals from
almost all the more important savings banks on the
Bombay side. No less than Rs.2,93,000 were paid out to
depositors in the Presidency Savings Bank from the 1st
to the 22nd April. The withdrawals in March from
Ahmedabad, Kaira, Broach and Surat totalled Rs.2,80,000
against Rs.1,10,000 in March, 1884, and the excess of
withdrawals over deposits for the whole Presidency in
January, February and March amounted to Rs.9,50,000.
The rest of India was not affected by the scare, in fact the
total number of Savings Bank accounts increased by
38,000 and the balances by Rs.59,00,000 despite the
heavy deficit in Bombay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The crisis of 1897 was purely economic and was due
to a widespread famine and abnormally high prices. Its
effect was felt in the Savings Bank for three years, the
balance falling from Rs.9,63,00,000 in 1896-7 to Rs.9,28,00,000
in 1897-8, and not reaching Rs.9,64,00,000
until 1899-00. The Bombay Postal Circle accounted
for Rs.30,50,000 out of the Rs.35,00,000 deficit in
India, the other deficits being in Madras, the North-West
Provinces and Oudh, and Bengal.</p>

<p>In 1907-8, as I have already mentioned, the country
was full of unrest. Leaflets calling on the men to mutiny
were being distributed broadcast among the Indian
regiments. Several Sikh regiments were supposed to be
seriously disaffected. The feeling in Bengal against the
British Government was being carefully nurtured, but
the real head-quarters of the anti-British movement was
Poona. In 1908-9 the balance of the Savings Bank
increased by Rs.5,00,000 only, which meant a serious
set-back considering the way in which the Post Office
was developing, but the figures for the Bombay Postal
Circle are peculiarly instructive. The number of
accounts actually increased from 264,558 to 271,604,
whereas the balance at the credit of depositors declined
from Rs.4,41,00,000 to Rs.4,30,00,000, the actual
decrease being Rs.11,46,388. Now in this year Bengal
showed an increase of nearly Rs.2,00,000, and the
decline in the proportional rate of increase in India was
found to be due to the heavy withdrawals of some
depositors in Bombay. There is reason to believe that
a number of wealthy persons belonging to the commercial
class use the Post Office Savings Bank in Bombay
as a convenient place to deposit money. This class of
depositors numbered 12,198 in 1907-08 and 12,503 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
1908-09, which is larger than in Bengal. Such people
do not deposit their money from motives of saving or
thrift, but merely take advantage of the convenience
which the Post Office offers as a safe place to keep, at
interest, money which can be immediately realized. The
rule which permits a depositor to have accounts in his
own behalf or on behalf of any minor relatives or any
minor of whom he happens to be the guardian has
opened a way to great abuse of the system. There is
nothing to prevent a man having any number of imaginary
relatives and opening accounts in all their names.
He can deposit the maximum in each account, and
naturally in times of crisis or when money is tight the
Savings Bank has to face the immediate withdrawal of
all these amounts. As one example of what is done, a
case came to light some years ago in which a depositor
at Dharwar was authorized to operate on eighty-three
accounts with a balance of nearly Rs.30,000. He was a
broker by profession and it was quite possible for him to
control a balance of Rs.2,00,000 in the Post Office, if
he wished to do so. Further inquiries made at the
time elicited that one depositor at Bijapur controlled
forty-two accounts, another at Surat thirty, and another
at Karwar nineteen. Such persons are really speculators
and are a danger to the Savings Bank, and it would be
interesting to know what proportion they hold of the
total deposits in the Bombay Circle. These deposits
represent a very high proportion of the total in India,
so that the action of any strong body of depositors in
Bombay has a very serious effect on the balance of the
Savings Bank.</p>

<p>The examination of transactions for the thirty years
previous to 1914 has this satisfactory result that, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
exception of the undesirable element in Bombay, a political
crisis, at any rate, seems to have no marked influence
upon the great mass of depositors in India. The number
of depositors on the 31st March, 1914, was 1,638,725 with
a balance of Rs.23,16,75,000. The outbreak of the war
with Germany, however, had a disastrous effect on the
Savings Bank balances. When the announcement was
made that the German Government had temporarily
confiscated the Savings Bank deposits in that country,
a regular panic ensued and within a few months about
100 millions of rupees were withdrawn. The action of
the Government of India, however, in meeting all
claims in full did a great deal to allay public fears, and
a certain amount of money came back later in the year,
but the balance on the 31st March, 1915, had declined
from about 231 to 149 millions of rupees. Since then
there has been a gradual recovery, and the balance on
the 31st March, 1918, was nearly 166 million rupees.
The recovery would have been much quicker but for
the large sale of five-year cash certificates in 1917-18 on
behalf of the War Loan. The price received was about
100 million rupees, of which a considerable portion was
withdrawn from Savings Bank deposits. At the same
time the small depositors were busy purchasing cash
certificates with money that would otherwise have been
put into the Post Office Savings Bank. Now that the
War is over and the rush for cash certificates has
ceased, there is every prospect that the Post Office
Savings Bank will shortly regain its former popularity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

THE PEOPLE AND THE POST OFFICE</h2>


<p>There is no branch of the Public Service that
comes into such close contact with the people
as the Post Office. Its officials are consulted
in all kinds of family troubles, they have to
deal with curious superstitions and beliefs and to overcome
the prejudices ingrained by an hereditary system of
caste. The official measure of the successful working
of the Department is gauged by the annual statistics,
but the real measure of its success may be learned from
the attitude of the people themselves. The Indian
villager dreads the presence of the Government officer
in his neighbourhood, but he makes an exception in the
case of Post Office employés. The postman is always
a welcome visitor and, if he fails to attend regularly, a
complaint is invariably made.</p>

<p>It is in the delivery of correspondence throughout the
smaller towns and rural tracts in India that the Post
Office has to face some of its most difficult problems.
Towns in India, with the exception of the Presidency
and more important towns, are mere collections of
houses, divided into "mohullas" or quarters. Few
streets have names, and consequently addresses tend to
be vague descriptions which tax all the ingenuity of the
delivery agents. Among the poorer classes definite local
habitations with names are almost unknown, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
best that a correspondent can do is to give the name of
the addressee, his trade and the bazaar that he frequents.
Such cases are comparatively simple, as the postman is
usually a man with an intimate knowledge of the quarter,
and the recipients of letters have no objection to be
described by their physical defects, such as "he with
the lame leg" or "the squint eye" or "the crooked
back"! Real difficulties, however, arise when articles
are addressed to members of the peripatetic population
consisting of pilgrims, boatmen and other wanderers.
There is an enormous boat traffic on the large rivers of
Bengal and Burma. The boat is the home of a family,
it wanders over thousands of miles of channels carrying
commodities, and letters to the owner rarely give anything
except a general direction to deliver the article
on board a boat carrying wood or rice from some river
port to another. The pilgrims who travel from shrine
to shrine in the country are also a puzzle to the Post
Office, and in sacred places, like Benares, special postmen
have to be trained to deliver their letters.</p>

<p>The forms of address are seldom very helpful for a
speedy distribution and delivery of the mail. The
following are characteristic of what a sorter has to deal
with any day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With good blessings to the fortunate Babu Kailas
Chandra Dey, may the dear boy live long. The
letter to go to the Baidiabati post office. The above-named
person will get it on reaching Baidiabati,
Khoragachi, Goynapara. (Bearing.)"</p>

<p>"To the one inseparable from my heart, the fortunate
Babu Sibnath Ghose, having the same heart as
mine. From post office Hasnabad to the village of
Ramnathpur, to reach the house of the fortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Babu Prayanath Ghose, District Twenty-four Parganas.
Don't deliver this letter to any person
other than the addressee, Mr. Postman. This my
request to you."</p>

<p>"If the Almighty pleases, let this envelope, having
arrived at the city of Calcutta in the neighbourhood
of Kulutola, at the counting house of Sirajudin and
Alladad Khan, merchants, be offered to and read
by the happy light of my eyes of virtuous manners
and beloved of the heart, Mian Sheikh Inayat Ali,
may his life be long! Written on the tenth of the
blessed Ramzan in the year 1266 of the Hejira of
our Prophet, and despatched as bearing. Having
without loss of time paid the postage and received
the letter, you will read it. Having abstained from
food and drink, considering it forbidden to you,
you will convey yourself to Jaunpur and you will
know this to be a strict injunction."</p></blockquote>

<p>The three addresses given below have been taken from
letters posted by Hindus to Hindus, and it will be
noticed that they merely bear the names of persons with
no indication of the place of delivery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To the sacred feet of the most worshipful, the most
respected brother, Guru Pershad Singh!"</p>

<p>"To his Highness the respected brother, beneficent
lord of us the poor, my benefactor, Munshi Manik
Chand."</p>

<p>"To the blessed feet of the most worshipful younger
uncle, Kashi Nath Banerji."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not uncommon for Europeans to receive letters
with honorific titles added to their names, in fact it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
would be considered impolite to address an English
gentleman in the vernacular by his mere name. Such a
thing is never done. Whatever address is given by the
writer, the Indian postman has his special methods of
noting it. He seldom knows English, and when names
are read out to him by the delivery clerk he scrawls his
own description on the back in a script that can only be
read by himself. A well-known judge of the Calcutta
High Court, Sir John Stevens, was much amused to find
that the words "Old Stevens Sahib" were constantly
written in the vernacular on the back of his letters, this
being done to distinguish him from his younger colleague,
Mr. Justice Stephens.</p>

<p>A story recently received from the Persian Gulf
explains how it is that letters sometimes fail to reach
their destinations despite the greatest care on the part
of the Post Office. The incident is worthy of the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>, and I will quote the account given by
the sub-postmaster of Linga.</p>

<p>"On the 8th of December in the year 1912 a well-known
merchant of Linga, Aga Abbasalli by name, informed
me that his agents at Bombay, Karachi and other
places in India had informed him by telegraph that for
the last two weeks they had received no mails from him.
He asked for an explanation from me for this, indirectly
holding me responsible and even threatening to report
me to you, for he maintained that the letters he sent to
the Post for many years past had, at least, always reached
their destination, if late, and that he could not now for
his life imagine as to how it was that the several letters
which he himself sent to the Post, by bearer, for the
last two weeks, were lost during transmission. As Abbasalli
was known to me, I sent word to him through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
somebody to the effect that, in the first place, he would
do well to examine the bearer with whom he sent his
letters to the Post. The bearer was thereupon called
by him and confronted with the question of his mails;
but before quoting the silly dolt's interesting reply it
would be better to note the following few points:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are two identical terms in Persian, the "Poos"
and the "Poost," which have three distinct meanings,
the word "Poos" meaning a dock, or, in such a place
as the port of Linga, only a shelter for ships' anchorage,
whilst the word "Poost" meaning (1) hides and skins,
or leather and (2) the Post Office. As far as pronunciations
are concerned it has been a very indiscriminate
colloquialism at Linga to pronounce both the above
said words alike as "Poos," without any regard to the
final "t" of the word "Poost"; and practically,
therefore, the word "Poos" has three separate meanings
as quoted above. The "Poost-e-Buzurg" or the
"Poos-e-Buzurg," literally equal to the big Post Office,
is used by the mass of people for the British Post Office
at Linga, as distinct from the Persian Post Office, which
is known as the "Poost-e-Ajam." But to many again
the "Poos-e-Buzurg" is known as the big dock, also
styled the "Poos-e-Aga Bedar" (Aga Bedar's dock), in
contradistinction from another which is smaller, and is
only known as the "Poos-e-Bazar," that is, the Bazar
dock. Moreover, both the big dock and the British
Post Office are situated somewhere near Aga Bedar's
Coffee shop, the latter being, however, a little farther
than the dock.</p>

<p>Having noted these points I now beg to revert to the
question put to his bearer by Abbasalli and the former's
reply thereto. "What did you do with my mails, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I gave you, for the last two weeks, to be conveyed to the
'Poost'?" asks Abbasalli in his vernacular, and the
bearer replies, "The first week when you told me to
carry your letters to the 'Poost' I <i>went</i> to the shoemaker's
and was putting them <i>exactly</i> amongst the
'Poost' (meaning leather and leather-ware), as ordered
by you, but, he won't let me do so, and said I should
carry the letters to the 'Poos-e-Buzurg' near Aga
Bedar's Coffee shop." "Ah! you blockhead, you,"
explained the exasperated merchant, "but, what did
you do with my letters after all when he told you to
carry them to the 'Poos-e-Buzurg'?" "Why, rest
easy on the point," says the bearer, "I carried them
exactly to the 'Poos-e-Buzurg' (meaning the big dock)
and threw the letters in. The first time when there was
plenty of water in the dock (on account of tide) I had
simply to throw your letters in, and I am sure they must
have reached their destination quite all right; but the
next week, when there was but little water in the dock,
I had to dig a pit in the sand to put the mails in, and
perhaps they may not have reached their destination."</p>

<p>Poor Abbasalli was quite perplexed and awfully sorry
to know that all the valuable letters written by him for
the two weeks, some containing cheques even, as I am
given to understand, were thus entirely washed away
by the merciless waves; but, no less embarrassed am I,
on hearing of the tomfoolery, to think of what blame it
may sometimes accidentally and unnecessarily entail
on a Postmaster, and I therefore venture to put this real
story before you, with the fullest hope that, in future,
complaints of a like nature may kindly be considered
only on their due merits.</p>

<p>I may be allowed to add that the story was related by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
me before H.B.M.'s Vice-Consul and the small European
Community at the Linga Club, and they all, while
sympathizing with me in my perplexity, enjoyed a hearty
laugh over the recital.</p>

<p>On the 31st March, 1918, there were over 19,410
post offices and 49,749 letter boxes in India to serve a
population of 319 million people in an area of 1,622,000
square miles. This gives a post office to about every
16,000 persons, or to each 83 square miles of country,
which seems a very poor service by comparison with
Western countries, but, when one considers that the
literate population of India is only 18,500,000, the
service is good and the prospect of future development
with the increase of education is enormous.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the Post
Office confines its energies to the literate population. It
is largely used by people who can neither read nor write,
and this is made possible by the existence of professional
letter-writers, who are to be found in every town and
village in the country. For a pice (farthing) they will
write an address, and for two pice they will write a
short letter or a postcard or fill up a money order,
though slightly higher fees are charged if the letter is
very long.</p>

<p>In rural tracts where it is not worth while to maintain
a post office, the people are served by a letter-box or by a
village postman who makes periodical visits and acts as
a travelling post office. It is a wonderful achievement
of the Department that there is scarcely a village in
India which does not lie within the beat of a village
postman. The competition between villages to obtain
post offices is often very keen, and a Postmaster-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
has many a troublesome decision to make, as to which of
two or three neighbouring villages is to have the honour
conferred upon it. While the matter is yet undecided
the competitors vie with each other in pouring correspondence
into the nearest post office in order to show
the postal importance of their respective villages, an
importance which is apt to decline sadly when once the
post office has been opened. On one occasion, when
Postmaster-General, I received application from two
villages A and B for the opening of post offices. There
happened to be an office in a village C close by, but the
applications stated that this village was separated from
them by a river, difficult to cross at most seasons and quite
impossible during the rains. The inspector who visited
the locality reported that the river could be crossed
dry-shod at most seasons and with little difficulty during
the monsoon, but that A was a much more important
place than C and that the post office ought to be transferred
there. A fresh complication was then started,
and the indignation of the villagers in C knew no bounds.
They threatened to carry the matter up to the Viceroy,
and for the time they began to post enough letters to
justify the existence of an office in the village. The
dispute was finally settled by establishing an office at
A in addition to the one at C, on condition that one or
the other would be closed if the postal work done did
not justify its continuance.</p>

<p>One of the most important duties of a Superintendent
is to watch carefully the work of village postmen.
Statistics are kept regularly of the articles delivered and
collected by them, and these statistics give a very true
indication of the places where new post offices are
required in rural tracts. In this way the Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
keeps in touch with the whole country, and a special
grant has been allowed by Government for opening
experimental offices in places which show signs of
needing permanent ones. An experimental office is
opened for a period of six months and, if it leads to a
development of correspondence and pays its way, it is
made permanent at the end of that time, but unless it is
a complete failure the experiment is extended up to
two years in order to give the people of the neighbourhood
every chance of retaining the office. This policy has
been most successful and has taught the village people
that they are largely responsible for the maintenance of
their own post offices. The postmaster is invariably a
local man, either the village schoolmaster or a shopkeeper,
who gets a small salary, which, combined with
the dignity of His Majesty's mails, gives him a direct
interest in making the office a profitable concern.</p>

<p>The annual statistics of the Post Office serve as a
barometer of the prosperity of India. The Department
has entered into the lives of the people with its
lines of communication, its savings bank, money orders,
payment of pensions and sale of quinine. It has only
one aim and that aim is recognized by all, namely, to do
the greatest good for the greatest number.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

THE INDIAN POSTMAN</h2>


<p>The conditions under which postal articles in
England and India are delivered differ so
vastly that a knowledge of Indian life is
necessary in order to understand the difficulties
that lie in the way of good delivery work in this
country. The smart official walking four miles an hour
and shooting the contents of his satchel into every
house on his beat with a rat-a-tat is unknown. House
doors in India have no knockers and no letter-boxes, and
among the better class inhabitants, both European and
Indian, it is customary to send messengers to the post
office to fetch the unregistered mail, so that to this
extent the postman's work is reduced. The balance of
the articles received by him often forms a strange
medley in many languages, of which perhaps he is able
to read one with difficulty. In a large town like Calcutta
letters are received addressed in as many as a dozen
different languages, and special clerks versed in the
various tongues have to be employed. Luckily people
of the same race are accustomed to congregate in the
same quarters of the town, and the postmen are able to
get some of the local residents to assist them in deciphering
many a doubtful address. In Bombay certain private
delivery agencies exist, which are recognized by the
Department and which work very satisfactorily. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the whole the distribution of letters to the public is
performed in a leisurely fashion which is quite in accordance
with the national character. One may often
see a postman, with the assistance of a dozen of the
literate inhabitants of the quarter, spelling out from a
dirty piece of folded paper an address, which turns out
to be one Gunga Din living near the temple of Hanuman
in the courtyard of some ancient who has died years ago,
but whose name is still perpetuated in the soil where his
house once stood. Gunga Din may be dead or vanished,
the quarter knows him no more, but his sister's grandnephew
arrives to take the letter, and after some haggling
agrees to pay the 1 anna due on it, for such letters
are invariably sent bearing. This little episode being
finished the postman proceeds on his beat to find another
enigmatical addressee, and is it any wonder that, although
his salary is often a low one, the Indian postman is one
of the most expensive delivery agents in the world?
He seldom delivers more than three hundred articles
a day, and in the Indian business quarters of the town
he gets rid of the majority of these at the post office
door, since the merchants and others who expect letters
always waylay the postman just as he is proceeding on
his beat, knowing well that it may be many hours before
he will find it convenient to visit them at their houses.</p>

<p>In the matter of slow delivery, however, the public
are more frequently to blame for delays than the postman,
especially in the case of articles which have to be
signed for. Parcels, money orders or registered letters
are taken at the door by a servant and, if the sahib is
at his bath or busy, there is a long and tedious wait
before the signed receipts are brought back. It is
extraordinary how callous people are in this respect
towards the interests of the Post Office and their own
neighbours, while they are always ready to complain if
the smallest delay or mistake occurs to any articles for
themselves. It can be easily understood that where
such conditions prevail, and that is all over India, fast
delivery is impossible, and the very best regulations for
getting the men quickly to their beats are useless when
they are detained unnecessarily at every house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i098.jpg" width="900" height="587" alt="" />
<div class="caption">COMBINED PASSENGER AND MAIL MOTOR VAN. KANGRA VALLEY SERVICE</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>In India most money orders are paid at the door by
postmen, and in towns, where there are large payments
to be made, special sets of postmen are employed for the
purpose. The rules regarding the payment of money
orders are very strict and, when the payees are not
well-known persons, identification by a respectable
resident is insisted upon. In large pilgrim resorts, like
Benares, where the pilgrims are continually getting
remittances and are necessarily unknown, there is a
special class of professional identifiers, consisting chiefly
of the innkeepers. These men for a small fee are always
ready to swear to the identity of any pilgrim for whom
a money order has arrived, and, strange to say, they are
often ready to pay up if it is found that their identification
was incorrect and that the money was paid to the
wrong person, a not unfrequent occurrence.</p>

<p>The postman, however, has to bear the brunt in case
of the identification not being complete, and his responsibility
in the matter is great. The convenience to
the public of having their money brought to their doors
is considerable, but it is a source of continual anxiety
and expense to the Post Office. Large sums of money
are entrusted daily to men on small pay. When the
limit, which a postman is allowed to take, is exceeded,
an overseer has to accompany him on his beat. Accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
have to be kept with each of the money order postmen
and must be settled before the day's cash can be closed.
Complaints of short payment are frequent and necessitate
detailed inquiries with usually very unsatisfactory results,
while the opportunities for blackmail are unlimited.
Despite these drawbacks, it would now be scarcely
possible to revert to a system by which everyone who
received a money order was obliged to take payment
of it at a post office, although greater security for both
the public and the Department would be gained thereby.
In certain parts of the country rural delivery is effected
with extraordinary difficulty. On the North-West
frontier the village postman goes in danger of his life
from trans-border tribesmen. In the forest tracts of
Central India the attacks of man-eating tigers are not
merely travellers' tales, but grim realities. In the
riverine districts of Eastern Bengal the postman has
to go from village to village by boat, and a storm on one
of these immense rivers is a bad thing to face in a frail
canoe. Nor is the boat journey the worst trouble; a
long tramp from the bank through swampy rice and jute
fields is often the only way to a village which has to be
visited twice a week. It is no wonder that the village
postman sometimes takes the easiest way of delivering
his letters by going to the most important place in his
beat on market day; for, if he cannot find the actual
addressees there, he is pretty sure to find some people
from the vicinity who are willing to take charge of their
neighbours' correspondence, but often not too careful
about delivering it. Hence the origin of much trouble,
complaints and hard swearing. Half a dozen witnesses
are always forthcoming to affirm that the postman
visited the village <i>in propria persona</i> on that particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
day, and to prove it the visit book with the signature of
one of the perjurers is produced. How can the mere
negative evidence of another half-dozen stand against
these convincing proofs?</p>

<p>On the Malabar side of the peninsula, where a very
strict form of Brahminism prevails, persons of low
caste are forbidden to enter the quarters of a town
occupied by Brahmins, and care has to be taken to place
these quarters in the beats of high caste postmen. In
Palghat there was almost a riot on one occasion when a
postman of inferior caste attempted to enter a Brahmin
street in the performance of his duties, and the Postmaster-General
was promptly called to order by the
indignant inhabitants. It was nearly a question whether
he should be fined and compelled to feed a thousand
beggars in accordance with the custom of the caste, but,
on proving that he was an indigent member of the
Indian Civil Service with a wife and family in England,
he was pardoned on admitting his error and promising
that no repetition of the offence should occur.</p>

<p>As a rule the Indian postman is reasonably honest and,
if not interfered with at an unseasonable moment by an
over-zealous inspector, his accounts will come out square
in the course of time. The maintenance of a private
debit account with the Department at the expense of
the payees of money orders is not unknown. The usual
practice is to withhold the payment of a certain number
of money orders for a few days and to use the money
for some profitable speculation, such as cotton gambling
or betting on the opium sales. Recently one of the most
respected postmen in the Big Bazaar of Calcutta was
found to have overreached himself in carrying out this
policy. He was on a very heavy money order beat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
used regularly to keep back a number of money orders
and forge the payees' receipts so as to satisfy the office
that payment had been made. He kept a private account
of these, and when he decided to pay any one whose
money had been withheld he filled up a blank form,
of which plenty are always available, and took the
payee's signature on this. The practice continued for
some time and, as everyone got paid in turn and the
postman was a most plausible fellow, no complaints were
made. At last his speculations went wrong, he got into
very deep water and an unpleasant person complained
to the postmaster that he had not received a money
order which he knew to have been sent weeks before.
This led to an inquiry, and the postman, being caught
unawares, was unable to account for about 17,000
rupees' worth of money orders due to various people in
the city.</p>

<p>One of the great problems of the Post Office in large
towns is to arrange deliveries and beats of postmen so
that people will get their letters in the shortest time
after the arrival of the mail trains. It used to be thought
that the best way to effect this purpose was to have
several delivery centres in order that postmen might be
near their beats and the waste of time in walking to the
beats be avoided. To enable this to be done, the Railway
Mail Service was expected to sort all postal articles into
separate bags for the different delivery offices. The
principle is excellent in theory, but in practice it has not
worked well and has led to indiscriminate missending to
wrong delivery offices. For instance, Madras at one
time had twenty-six delivery offices and, if people could
have been induced to address their correspondence to
one of these offices with the word (Madras) in brackets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
underneath, there might have been some hope of it
being properly sorted by the Railway Mail Service, but
probably 80 per cent of articles were simply addressed
to Madras with or without the name of a street, so that
the sorters were set an impossible task and the General
Post Office had to maintain a special staff for sorting
and conveying such letters to the offices from which they
would eventually be delivered. The present policy is
to have as few delivery offices as possible, and to have
postmen conveyed to more distant beats. This has
proved far more satisfactory; it relieves the work in the
R.M.S., enables the postmen to be kept under better
control and reduces the possibility of articles going
astray.</p>

<p>While working at the best arrangements for delivery at
Calcutta Mr. Owens, late Presidency Postmaster, devised
the system of what is known for want of a better name
as "continuous delivery." Every beat is provided with
a locked box placed in a shop or some suitable place in
the beat, and the letters for delivery are placed in this
box by messengers sent direct from the post office. The
postman goes straight to his beat and remains on duty
there for six hours, he finds his letters in the box and is
supposed to make the complete round of his beat every
hour, delivering articles and clearing the pillar boxes
<i>en route</i>. When he returns to the locked box he finds a
fresh consignment of letters for delivery, and deposits
those that he has collected for despatch, to be taken
away by the messenger on his next visit. The system is
a good one and has worked well. It saves labour and,
if the beats are properly supervised and the postmen
work conscientiously, a great quickening up of delivery
is effected. If, however, supervision is at all lax, human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
nature asserts itself, postmen are inclined to loiter and
they allow letters to accumulate so that one round can
be made to do the work of two. Owing to the difficulty
of supervision, the continuous delivery system has not
many ardent supporters in the Post Office at the present
time.</p>

<p>The postman is, in fine, one of the most important
factors in the Department, and upon his energy and
honesty much depends. It therefore behoves the
authorities to see that a good class of man is recruited.
In addition to being able to read and write the language
of that part of the country in which he serves, he should
know enough English to be able to read addresses easily,
but in order to obtain this class of man careful recruitment
is necessary and a good initial salary with reasonable
prospects of promotion must be given. Much has been
done in recent years to improve the status of postmen
and all branch postmasterships, which are not held by
extra-departmental agents, are now open to them. This
is a great step forward. The Department used to be
very parsimonious in the matter of uniforms, and in
many important offices postmen had to pay for them
themselves. Nor was there any uniformity even in
each circle about the uniforms supplied by Government.
In one town red coats and blue turbans were seen, in
another blue coats and red turbans, in another khaki
coats and nondescript turbans, while the men who
supplied themselves with uniform presented at times
the most extraordinary appearance. The pattern of
postmen's uniform has now been standardized for each
circle, and uniforms are supplied free of cost in all head
offices and large sub-offices. Warm clothing is also given
in all places with a cold climate. There is no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
about the value of a uniform to a postman. It adds a
certain amount of dignity to him and, like the soldier,
he is the better man for having a distinctive badge of
office. The pay has recently been greatly improved
and much has been done to ameliorate conditions under
which they serve. There are over 27,000 postmen in
India; the interests of these men are identical with
those of the Department, and their welfare should be the
aim of every postal officer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

POST OFFICE BUILDINGS</h2>


<p>"I don't think" was the terse though somewhat
vulgar reply of a well-known district officer on
the western side of India when asked if he
would like to have a post office erected in a
conspicuous place at the head-quarters of his district.
He was willing to give the site in question for a clock
tower, a public library or even a statue of one of his
predecessors, but a post office, "No, thank you." The
reason for this attitude may be easily understood by those
who have seen the ordinary Indian post office of a few
years ago. It used generally to be a rented building quite
unsuited for the purpose and made perfectly hideous by
small additions and projections constructed from time
to time in order to meet demands for increased space.
The windows and doors were used not for light and air
nor even for giving access to the interior, but for business
purposes. They were blocked up with the exception of
a small hole just the size of a pane of glass, through
which the members of the public had to try to get a
clerk to attend to their requirements. When a Government
building existed it was very little better, except
in the matter of repairs. The interior of the ordinary
post office was a dreadful sight a few years ago, a mass of
untidy tables, a large number of cupboards, known in
India as almirahs, ill-designed sorting cases and dirt, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
last article being the most prevalent everywhere. Letters
were sorted on the floor for convenience, and the delivery
table with its ragged occupants, who did duty for postmen,
was a sight for the gods.</p>

<p>The position of a post office in a town is a matter of
the first importance, but the chief object of the authorities
in the early days of the Imperial Post Office seems
to have been economy. As a building in a back street
naturally costs less than one in a main street, many of the
city offices are hidden away in the most inaccessible slums.
It is, indeed, a case of Mohamed and the mountain, and
the Post Office, secure in its monopoly, was not going
to afford any unnecessary conveniences to its clients.
Many of my readers will doubtless recall some of those
upstairs offices in big cities, which do an enormous
amount of work, especially in the afternoon, the approach
being a single staircase just broad enough for one person
to ascend. Imagine the turmoil at the busy hours of the
day. In Bara Bazar, Calcutta, and Benares City, two
famous instances which come to mind at the moment,
where there is a heavy despatch of parcels, the confined
space round the parcel windows was the scene of a petty
riot every afternoon. Such a state of affairs could not
exist for a month in a country where the better class of
people perform their own post office business; unfortunately
in India all this kind of work is done by native
messengers who are not particular about the surroundings
of an office and usually have plenty of time to spare.
Things, however, improved in recent years under the
direction of Sir Arthur Fanshawe and Sir Charles
Stewart-Wilson, both of whom had the critical faculty
strongly developed. Assisted by the genius of Mr.
James Begg, Consulting Architect to the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of India, they have done much to improve the modern
post office, with the result that the Department now
has some really fine buildings. For beauty of design
the new Bombay General Post Office, completed in
1910, is one of the finest in the East. The reproduction
of it in this book gives but little idea of its
splendid proportions, and its internal structure has been
planned with a view to facilitate postal work and to
allow for future expansion.</p>

<p>The General Post Office in Calcutta was built in 1868
from designs made by Mr. Granville, Architect to the
Government of India. The site is of great historical
interest owing to its association with the tragedy of the
Black Hole of Calcutta. The building is hardly large
enough now for the great mass of work which it has to
transact and, although the removal of the Postmaster-General's
Office and the Sorting Branch has somewhat
relieved the congestion, there is already a demand for
increased accommodation. The same thing has happened
in Madras where there is a large Post and Telegraph
Office facing the sea, designed by Mr. Chisholm and
opened to the public in 1885. The expansion of business
has outgrown the capacity of the building, and the time
has come to construct a new post office and to use the
present building as a Telegraph Office. Most head
offices and important sub-offices are now designed to provide
a proper hall for the public who wish to transact
business, with a counter for clerks and sufficient open
space in the building to allow each branch to work
independently and in comfort under the supervision of
a responsible officer. At Lahore, Nagpur, Patna, Chittagong,
Bareilly, Rawalpindi, Cawnpore, Howrah, Poona,
Agra, Allahabad, Mandalay, Benares, Sholapur and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Mount Road Madras, excellent offices have been recently
constructed, and the next few years will see Rangoon,
Delhi, Dacca, Darjeeling, Ajmere, Ahmedabad and
several other large towns provided with post office
buildings, not only scientifically planned, but handsomely
designed.</p>

<p>Apart from its architectural features the essentials in
a post office building are very much those of a bank,
namely, space, facility for supervision and an arrangement
of the branches dealing with the public, so that anyone
entering the office to do postal business can find his way
immediately to the clerk concerned. Space is most
necessary, especially in the sorting and delivery of mails.
In crowded offices thefts occur, packets of mails get
mixed up and shot into wrong bags, and proper supervision
is almost impossible. The old Indian system of
letting the public stand in the veranda of the post office
and transact business through the windows of the
buildings has always been fatal to good and quick work.
In the first place it is not easy to find the proper window
for the exact purpose one requires, and there are seldom
sufficient for all the branches. In the second place, when
one has discovered the right window, the clerk is seated
inside some distance away, and it is often difficult to
attract his attention. The only sensible arrangement is
a hall with a proper counter and screen on which the
departments are clearly indicated, and the clerks sitting
right up face to face with the public. The postal clerk
has the gift of complete aloofness when his services are in
the greatest request, but it requires extra strong nerves
to feign indifference to a man who is looking straight at
you two feet away and shouting his demands in unintelligible
Hindustani, especially if he hasn't yet breakfasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and the weather is very hot. The real value of
the counter is, in fine, that it enables all work with the
public to be performed in half the time.</p>

<p>Except in the very largest offices where the postmaster
sits in some secluded abode like an Olympian god,
the postmaster's seat should be in the main office and
readily accessible to the public. Deputy and assistant
postmasters are very fine fellows, but nothing can
compensate for the eagle eye of the Head. It is extraordinary
how quickly a delivery gets out when he is
present to urge it along, and how swiftly one gets one's
money orders or savings bank deposits when he is looking
on. For this reason he should be always within hail and,
if he can accustom himself to deal courteously with the
public and treat his staff with justice and consideration,
he will be the man that the Post Office requires.</p>

<p>The policy in past years of obtaining rented buildings
for post offices has proved a serious misfortune to the
Department. They are seldom or never suitable for
public offices, and the various attempts to adapt them
for postal purposes have been expensive and unsuccessful.
Every addition means an increase of rent and, with each
renewal of the lease, the rental is regularly enhanced.
I don't think that it is an exaggeration to say that
throughout India the rents paid for Post Office buildings
have increased by 50 per cent in the last twenty-five
years. In many instances the total value of the house
itself has been paid many times over, and the Department
still continues to pay an exorbitant price for the privilege
of occupying the ruins. No more miserable or extravagant
policy than this can be imagined, and in large
stations the Post Office is absolutely in the hands of the
landlord who can demand what he likes when a lease
expires, a position which he is inclined to take full
advantage of. In recent years the folly of this system
has become more and more apparent, and efforts are
now being made to provide Government buildings for
all important offices, but any such scheme must necessarily
take time since good sites in suitable positions are
seldom available and funds are strictly limited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>A far-sighted man who thinks that his business will
expand in time will provide for such expansion even as a
speculation and, when expansion is a certainty as in the
case of the Post Office which doubles its business in ten
years, to provide merely for the needs of the moment is
the falsest of false economy. The standard rule laid
down by Sir Charles Stewart-Wilson with respect to
new buildings was that, when a new post office is required,
the space necessary for the office at the time should
be taken and multiplied by two. Then there would be
some hope of the accommodation being sufficient at all
events for one official generation. There is hardly a
single office built more than twenty years ago which is
not now overcrowded and which will not have to be
enlarged at considerable expense. If this lesson is taken
to heart by the designers of our new post offices, they
will earn the gratitude of future generations of postmasters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

THE POST OFFICE IN INDIAN STATES</h2>


<p>The continent of India is divided into territory
of two kinds, namely, British India and Indian
States. There are 652 States with varying
degrees of independence according to the
treaties that exist between them and the British Government.
Except in three of these, Mysore, Travancore and
Cochin, no proper postal system can be said to have
existed before the Imperial Post Office of India was
established. In Mysore the Anche, a local post, was a
very old institution, and its extension to the whole
Kingdom was one of the earliest measures of the reign of
Chikka Devaraj Wadayar in the year 1672. A similar
system known as Anchel has existed for many years in
Travancore and Cochin, but its origin is not known.
Other States had no Post Offices in the proper sense of
the term, and when the Post Office of India was
established it extended its operations to many of these
without any question. From many of the larger States,
however, the Imperial Post Office was rigidly excluded,
with the result that there was great difficulty in maintaining
any postal communication between them and
British India. Gradually certain States began to develop
postal organizations of a distinct and independent
character with special postage stamps of their own and
others had organizations without any postage stamps. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
kinds of different arrangements existed and the position
is well described by Sir Frederic Hogg, the Director-General,
in his Annual Report of 1878-9:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In some places the delivery of correspondence proceeding
from the Imperial Post is effected by an agency
independent of this Department, in other places this
agency is subject to Imperial Post control; while sometimes
again both descriptions of distributing agencies are
employed. There exists an arrangement under which
the Imperial Post is subsidized for the delivery of correspondence,
and there are some localities in Native territory
which are destitute of any postal organization, and where
letters cannot be delivered at all. Nor is diversity of
method the sole difficulty that has to be met. Beyond
the limits of this Department information on postal
matters can hardly be obtained. Native States issue
no <i>Postal Guide</i>, print no lists of post offices and publish
no postal matters for the information of the public.
Postal information is not available. It is uncertain
whether a letter will ever be delivered. Not only is
prepayment to destination in many cases impossible, but
correspondence is subject on delivery to arbitrary and
unknown charges. Registration is often impossible.
Postcards don't exist and the inhabitants of Native
States, which oppose Imperial Post extensions, are
debarred from the benefits of the Money Order, Insurance
and Value-Payable systems and other facilities
afforded by the Imperial post office to the public. Restrictions
of correspondence must be the natural consequence
of this diversity of system or absence of system,
and the only real remedy lies in the gradual extinction of
all post organizations and their supersession by the
Imperial Post. Such a measure must entail great expense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>for several years, but uniformity of postage rates, rules
and conditions would result and the cost involved would
doubtless ultimately be more than covered by increased
revenue."</p></blockquote>

<p>The first case that came prominently to notice was
that of the Patiala State with which there was considerable
trouble regarding postal exchanges. A proposal
was made in 1880 to extend the Imperial Postal System
to the State, but it was not acceptable to the Council of
Regency, and after much discussion it was decided to
prepare a Convention according to which a mutual
exchange of correspondence could be arranged. The
Convention was ratified in 1884 and similar ones were
made with Gwalior, Jhind and Nabha in 1885 and with
Faridkot and Chamba in 1886, the last four constituting
with Patiala the group known as the Phulkian States.
The Conventions with these States are all similar and
to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) There shall be a mutual exchange of correspondence,
parcels and money orders between
the Imperial Post Office and the post offices of
the Native State, this exchange including
registered, insured and value-payable articles,
and being governed by the rules of the <i>Indian
Postal Guide</i>, as periodically published.</p>

<p>(2) Certain selected post offices in British India and
in the Native States shall be constituted offices
of exchange, and these offices shall be the sole
media of exchange for insured and value-payable
articles and money orders, and shall be
entrusted with the duty of preparing the
accounts arising from the exchange.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>(3) Indian postage stamps and postal stationery overprinted
with the name of the Native State shall
be supplied by the Government of India on
indent at cost price, and shall be used for the
purpose of prepaying inland correspondence
posted in the State.</p>

<p>(4) The Government of India shall bear the cost of
conveying mails over British territory, and the
Native State shall bear the cost of conveying
mails within the limits of the State.</p>

<p>(5) The Imperial Post Office shall establish no new
post offices in Native State territory without the
permission of the Durbar, excepting at Railway
Stations or within British Cantonments, the
Durbar undertaking the establishment of any
post offices or letter-boxes required in State
territory by the Imperial Post Office.</p>

<p>(6) On foreign correspondence posted in the State,
postage shall be prepaid only by means of
Imperial postage stamps not bearing the overprint,
postage stamps with such overprint not
being recognized for the purpose.</p>

<p>(7) Monthly accounts shall be kept of the amounts
due to the Imperial Post Office by the Native
State and vice versa upon the money order
exchange.</p></blockquote>

<p>No sooner had these Conventions been agreed to than
Government began to regret the step that had been
taken, and it was then seen that real postal unity in the
country could only be effected by the abolition of
separate systems in the different States, a policy directly
opposed to that which had been adopted towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Gwalior and the Phulkian States. When, therefore, the
Dewan or Prime Minister of Mysore asked for a Convention,
he was met with a definite refusal, and an
alternative proposal was made to the Mysore Government
that the Imperial Post Office should undertake the
postal service of the State. The proposal was accepted
in 1887, and the Mysore Anche was abolished at the end
of 1888. This measure of amalgamation, in which the
Mysore Darbar rendered substantial assistance, was
carried into effect from the beginning of 1889. The
facilities afforded by the Indian Post Office, which were
thus extended to the whole of Mysore, were fully
appreciated by the people and resulted in a great development
of postal business, the number of articles delivered
having increased in the first year by no less than a
million.</p>

<p>The case of Mysore was such a striking example of the
benefits arising from the unification of a State Post
Office with the Imperial system that Sir Arthur Fanshawe,
the Director-General, used every endeavour to
extend the policy to other States. The result was that
the Kashmir State followed suit in 1894, and shortly
afterwards Bamra, Nandgaon and Pudakottah. The
efforts to win over Hyderabad, the premier State of
India, were not successful. Although negotiations were
extended over many years and every inducement was
offered, the Nizam steadfastly refused to surrender the
management of his own Posts as a separate system.</p>

<p>In 1906 Mr. Stewart-Wilson, who succeeded Sir
Arthur Fanshawe as Director-General, started a fresh
campaign for the unification of the Post Office all over
India, and he succeeded in getting Indore and Bhopal
to join in 1908. Since then Jaipur asked for a Convention,
but this was refused in accordance with the policy
that Conventions were undesirable as only tending to
perpetuate the many diversities which Government were
anxious to abolish. The position at present is that out
of 652 States, 637, including Faridkote which voluntarily
abandoned its Convention in 1904, have cast in their lot
with the Imperial Post Office, The number of outstanding
States is thus fifteen, of which only Hyderabad,
Gwalior, Jaipur, Patiala and Travancore are of much
importance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<div class="caption">GENERAL POST OFFICE. MADRAS</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The policy of the Government of India has been
clearly laid down in the correspondence dealing with the
unification of the Hyderabad Posts with the Imperial
Post Office. The Government is unwilling to take over
the postal system of any State without the full consent
of the Durbar or State Council, but it exercises the
right of opening an Imperial post office or placing a
letter-box anywhere in a State if Imperial interests
require it. As a rule such offices are opened at railway
stations or military cantonments, but they may be
opened elsewhere in cases of real necessity. The aim of
the Government is towards complete unification of the
Post Office all over the country. The inconvenience of
separate systems is keenly felt, and the inequality of
Conventions on mutual terms between a great Empire
and a small State is obvious. The principle upon which
each country of the Postal Union retains its own postage
on foreign correspondence is based on the theory that
for every letter sent a letter is received, and that the
transit charges are fairly apportioned, and in many
cases the difference is slight when spread over a long
period. When the principle is applied to a small State
in a big country like India, the burden of handling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
correspondence is very unevenly divided. For every
ten miles a letter has to be conveyed within the State,
the Post Office of India may have to convey it a thousand
miles or more at a cost altogether out of proportion to
the postage receipts for half the correspondence handled.
The difference is still more marked in the case of parcels
and money orders and, despite all efforts to make the
division of fees correspond with the work done by each
administration, the position has never been satisfactory.</p>

<p>The postal future of the few States that still refuse
to join the Imperial system is uncertain. All compromises
have been rejected, and the arguments of
prestige and prejudice are used to contest those of
uniformity and convenience. As matters stand now the
inconsistencies of small postal systems within the Indian
Empire seem likely to continue until a firm hand on the
one part and enlightened opinion on the other combine
to abolish them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

THE OVERLAND ROUTE</h2>


<p>Overland trade between Europe and India
has existed from the earliest times and was
fully developed during the Roman Empire.
After the overthrow of the Western Empire
by Odoacer in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 476 and during the struggles with the
Persians and Saracens the overland trade with the East
languished until the consolidation of the Saracenic power
at Damascus, Cairo and Bagdad. It was again thrown
into disorder by the ascendancy of the Turkish Guard at
Bagdad, and did not revive until the thirteenth century,
when, as the result of the Crusades, Venice and Genoa
became the great emporia for Eastern spices, drugs and
silks. The merchandise came by land to the ports of the
Levant and the Black Sea, but the capture of Constantinople
by the Ottoman Turks in 1483 drove the
traffic to Alexandria, which continued to be the mart
for Eastern wares until the discovery of the Cape route
to India altered the whole conditions of trade.</p>

<p>The first historical attempt to reach England from
India by the overland route was made in 1777 when
Lord Pigot, Governor of Madras, was placed in confinement
by his own Council. Both parties attempted to
avoid loss of time in representing their case to the Board
of Directors by despatching messengers up the Red
Sea and across Egypt. The Council's messenger, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Dibdin, managed to land at Tor near the mouth of the
Gulf of Suez, to make his way across Egypt and finally
to reach his destination. Not so Mr. Eyles Irwin, the
messenger of the Governor. He sailed in the brig
<i>Adventure</i>, and after many mishaps only succeeded in
reaching Cosseir on the Red Sea in July, where he and his
companions were detained by the Turks.</p>

<p>In 1778, after the fall of Pondicherry, Warren Hastings
was determined that the good news should go home via
Suez, and he engaged to send Mr. Greuber by a fast
sailing packet to that port with the despatches. The proposal
was strenuously opposed by Francis and Wheler, but
Hastings, having Barwell on his side and a casting vote in
Council, was able to carry out his intention. Mr. Greuber
managed to get through by this route, but neither
Hastings nor the Board of Directors anticipated the objections
which the Ottoman Porte had to any navigation
of the Red Sea by the Company's ships. In 1779 the
Porte issued a firman putting a stop to all trade between
Egypt and India by the way of Suez and decreed that
ships from India could proceed only as far as Jeddah. If
despatches were to be sent by Suez, the messenger conveying
them had to travel from Jeddah by Turkish ship.
This was a hopeless arrangement and meant endless delay,
besides which the fate of messengers or of any Europeans
crossing the desert between Suez and Cairo was very uncertain.
The terrible dangers and difficulties of the
journey are graphically described in Mrs. Fay's letters.
Owing to the opposition of the Turkish Government the
overland route was abandoned for some time, but in 1797
an arrangement was made with them and the company's
cruiser <i>Panther</i>, under the command of Captain Speak,
sailed in that year with despatches. She left Bombay on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the 9th March and reached Suez on the 5th May, where
she waited for three months for return despatches; but
since these did not arrive she returned to Bombay, and,
being delayed by contrary winds at Mocha, finally arrived
after an absence of thirteen months.</p>

<p>In 1798 the Government carried into execution a project
which they had long been contemplating, namely,
the establishment of a mail route from India to England
by the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia. A number of
packet boats were put on this service which plied between
Bombay and Basrah once a month. Private correspondence
was allowed to be sent by this route upon the
following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. No letter was to exceed four inches in length, two
in breadth, nor to be sealed with wax.</p>

<p>2. All letters were to be sent to the Secretary to
Government with a note specifying the name of
the writer and with the writer's name under the
address, to be signed by the Secretary previous
to deposit in the packet, as a warrant of permission.</p>

<p>3. Postage had to be paid upon the delivery of each
letter at the rate of 10 rupees for a single letter
weighing one-quarter of a rupee, for letters
weighing half a rupee 15 rupees, and for letters
weighing one rupee 20 rupees.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two mails were sent by each despatch, one by Bagdad
and one by Aleppo. We are not told if many private
people were wealthy enough to pay these overwhelming
rates of postage or were prepared to face the irksome conditions
imposed upon anyone using this route.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of the nineteenth century the East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
India Company continued to retain a Resident at Busra
long after their trade had ceased to be of any consequence.
One of his principal duties was in connection
with the desert post, by which despatches were forwarded
to England from the Bombay Government. Later on
the post of Resident was abolished, and in 1833 the
desert post was closed, as despatches, when forwarded
overland, were sent in the Company's cruisers via Cosseir
on the Red Sea and Cairo.</p>

<p>On the 5th November, 1823, a meeting was held in the
Town Hall at Calcutta to discuss the feasibility of establishing
communication with Great Britain by means of
steam navigation via the Mediterranean, Isthmus of Suez
and the Red Sea. A premium of £10,000 was offered to
the first company or society that would bring out a steam
vessel to India and establish the communication between
India and England. The first steamer to reach India via
the Cape was the <i>Enterprise</i>, commanded by Captain
Johnson, in 1826. She was a vessel of five hundred tons
burthen with two engines of sixty horse-power each and
also built to sail, and she performed the journey in fifty-four
days. Her great fault was want of room for coal, a
circumstance which nearly led to a disaster on the voyage,
as the coal, which had to be packed on top of the boilers,
ignited and the fire was extinguished with difficulty. The
credit for establishing the Suez route belongs to Lieutenant
Thomas Waghorn, of the East India Company's
Marine. He was the first to organize direct communication
between England and India by means of fast
steamers in the Mediterranean and Red Seas. In 1830
the steamer <i>Hugh Lindsay</i> made the first voyage from
Bombay to Suez, and Waghorn from that time worked
hard at his scheme. He built eight halting places in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
desert between Cairo and Suez, provided carriages and
placed small steamers on the Nile and the canal of Alexandria,
Waghorn's triumph was on the 31st October,
1845, when he bore the mails from Bombay, only thirty
days old, into London. This memorable feat settled the
question of the superiority of the overland as compared
with the old Cape route, but it was not given effect to
without great opposition from the shipping companies.</p>

<p>In 1840 the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company
obtained a charter of incorporation, and one of the
conditions was that steam communication with India
should be established within two years. This condition
was fulfilled by the despatch of the <i>Hindustan</i> to India
via the Cape of Good Hope in 1842. The advantages of
the route across the isthmus of Suez were, however, too
obvious, and the P. and O. Company took up a contract
for the conveyance of mails between London and Suez,
while vessels of the East India Company's navy conveyed
them between Suez and Bombay. The journey from
Alexandria to Suez was most uncomfortable for passengers.
It was made by canal boat to Cairo, and then by
two-wheeled vehicles across the desert to Suez. In 1844
a contract was given for five years to the P. and O. Company
to establish a regular mail service in the Indian seas,
with a subsidy of £160,000 a year for the combined India
and China services. This contract was subsequently extended,
and in January, 1853, a fresh contract was concluded
with the Company under which fortnightly
communication was secured between England, India and
China, with a service once in two months between Singapore
and Sydney. On the 7th July, 1854, a supplementary
contract was entered into for the conveyance of
mails between Southampton and Bombay through Alexandria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
by which way the transit time was twenty-eight
days. The total subsidy under both contracts was
£224,300 a year. The sea postage collected by the
United Kingdom and India was devoted to the payment
of this subsidy, and any deficiency was borne equally by
both countries. In 1867 a fresh contract for twelve years
was concluded with the Company for a weekly service to
and from Bombay and a fortnightly one to and from
China and Japan. The annual subsidy was fixed at
£400,000, to be increased to £500,000 if such should be
necessary, in order to enable the Company to pay 6 per
cent dividend upon their capital. This absurd clause was
cancelled in 1870, and the annual subsidy was fixed at
£450,000.</p>

<p>The Suez Canal was opened in 1869, but owing to
difficulties with the British Government it was not used
for the passage of the mail steamers until many years
later. In 1880 the Southampton route was abolished,
and the contract for the weekly service stipulated for a
transit time of 17&frac12; days between London and Bombay
via Alexandria and Suez. It was not until 1888 that the
mails were sent by the Suez Canal instead of by rail across
Egypt.</p>

<p>During the term of the contract 1867-1869, the port
for reception and despatch of mails was Marseilles.
Arrangements were made in the new contract of 1869
for the substitution of Brindisi for Marseilles on the completion
of the Mont Cenis Tunnel and railway, and
Brindisi remained the European port for the reception
and despatch of mails until the outbreak of war in 1914.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 1st July, 1898, a new contract was drawn up
for a combined Eastern and Australian service. The
transit time between London and Bombay was limited
to 14&frac12; days and the annual subsidy was fixed at £330,000,
of which £245,000 represented the payment for the service
between Brindisi, India, Ceylon, the Straits Settlements
and China. The last contract was entered into
with the Company on the 1st July, 1908, for seven years.
The transit time between Brindisi and Bombay was reduced
to 11&frac14; days with an allowance of thirty-six hours
in the monsoon, and the total subsidy was fixed at
£305,000.</p>

<p>The present contract with the P. and O. Company
expires in 1922, and what fate the future has in store for
the Suez Canal route we cannot tell. There has been
much talk of a through railway from Calais to Karachi,
and with the Channel tunnel completed this would
mean a railway route from London to India. The cost,
however, of transporting the Indian mail, which often
consists of more than ten thousand bags, over this enormous
distance by rail would probably be prohibitive.
Under the International Postal Convention each country
traversed would have the right to claim a territorial
transit charge, and with fast steamers between Marseilles
and Bombay the saving in time might not be so great as
has been anticipated.</p>

<p>Another competitor to the steamer service has appeared
recently in the form of Aviation. Several
proposals for an Air Mail Service between England
and India have been made, but the success of long
distance transits by air is not yet assured.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the old familiar scenes at Port
Said and Aden will soon be as unknown to the Eastern
traveller as Table Bay and St. Helena. The old trade
routes are to be revived again, no longer with slow
and picturesque caravans, but with rushing trains and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
aeroplanes. Despite these prophecies the P. and O.
continue to build new ships, they book passages even
a year ahead, and are preparing to tender for a new
mail contract. Is this mere contempt, is it optimism,
or is it the adoption of Warren Hastings' motto: "Mens
aequa in arduis"?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

THE SEA POST OFFICE</h2>


<p>In 1859 the Postmaster-General, United Kingdom,
announced that it had been determined to open
the homeward-bound mails on board the steamers
between Alexandria and Southampton and Alexandria
and Marseilles, with a view to effect a partial or
complete sorting of the letters and newspapers. He also
suggested that the clerks entertained for this service
might during the voyage out be employed in sorting the
letters and newspapers contained in the mails despatched
from England to India. At the same time he inquired
whether the Government of India would be willing to
bear their proportion of the cost of the scheme. The
offer was declined on the ground that English clerks could
not sort letters correctly for stations in India, where there
were many places with the same name.</p>

<p>In 1860 the Bombay Government reported that on the
Europe side of Egypt the former practice of sending an
Admiralty Agent with each steamer of the Peninsular and
Oriental Company in charge of mails had been abolished,
and instead the Company carried a couple of post office
clerks to sort the homeward mail. They embarked on
the Marseilles boat at Alexandria, and before arriving at
Malta they sorted all the letters for transmission via Marseilles.
At Malta these clerks were transferred to the
vessel for Southampton, and when the steamer reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that port all the heavy mails were sorted. The Bombay
Government suggested that a similar arrangement might
be adopted east of Suez, the clerks told off for the work
being employed in the Bombay post office when they
were not engaged on the steamer. The Bombay Government's
suggestion was negatived on the ground of expense
in view of the unsatisfactory state of the Indian finances
at the time.</p>

<p>In 1864 the subject was revived by Lord Lawrence,
The Director-General, Mr. Monteath, agreed with the
objections formerly urged that English Post Office clerks
could not sort letters for all stations in India, but held
that they could sort letters received by the Marseilles
route only for Bombay and put up in boxes the letters
and papers for the several Governments or Administrations
in the provinces. It was then decided that sorting
to the above limited extent might best be done in
London and that, if it were done by a sorting establishment
on a steamer west of Suez, the Indian Government
might be reasonably called upon for a contribution. Thus
the discussion ended for the time and nothing was done.</p>

<p>The subject was revived in 1868, when weekly communication
between England and India was established.
In the new contract with the Peninsular and Oriental
Company provision was made to accommodate a postal
sorting office and give free passages to sorters on the
vessels east of Suez. The Government of India decided
to take advantage of this arrangement and authorized
experimental sea-sorting establishments on the scale of
six sets of sorters for fifty-two voyages annually in each
direction between Bombay and Suez. Each set consisted
of a head sorter, a sorter and two packers. The calculation
was based on an allowance of fifteen days each way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
for the voyage to and from Suez, with an interval of from
two days to six days between a return from Suez and the
next departure from Bombay, Notice was at the same
time given for the withdrawal of the Naval Agents employed
on board the steamers. One of the principal
duties of these Naval Agents appears to have been to
report whether penalties for delay should be exacted or
not according to the circumstances in which the delays
occurred.</p>

<p>In his final report in 1870 on the working of the
system, as a result of which the establishment was
permanently continued, the Director-General described
the work of the sea post office as "embracing the sorting
of mails for transmission to the various localities of a
huge continent, as well as the checking of the accounts
made out in respect of such correspondence by the
various European offices from which the mails are
received.... It is a work which, in an office on shore,
would be distributed among a large establishment, each
member of which would have to learn only a small
portion of the business; and it is a work the bad performance
of which even occasionally will give rise to the
most serious consequences." The experimental formation
of the sea-sorting office had succeeded so well that the
inward overland mail was received at Bombay ready for
despatch into the interior, instead of having to be
detained there for about six hours, which often involved
the loss of a whole day for certain places. The Bombay
delivery ticket-holders got their overland letters at the
post office window about ten minutes after the mail had
arrived, and the delivery to Calcutta ticket-holders of
letters, which had been sorted at sea, was similarly expedited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian sea-sorting office sorted letters for the
United Kingdom, but the London General Post Office
did not reciprocate by sorting the mail for India, the
latter being done at sea, which enabled London to
dispense with a large expenditure for Naval Agents.
Although the revised contract with the Peninsular and
Oriental Company provided for proper sorting accommodation
on their vessels eastward of Suez, there was no
similar provision westward of Suez; on the contrary,
it was specially provided that the master or commander
of the vessel should take charge of the mails to the west
of Suez. The fact was that the work done by the Indian
sea-sorting office on the homeward voyage was so complete
and thorough that the British Post Office was able
to abolish all its sea-sorting establishments west of Suez.</p>

<p>The steady growth in the work to be done and in the
number of men required to cope with it gave rise to
many difficulties in connection with the provision of
suitable and adequate accommodation on board the
steamers, the proper supervision of the staff, and the
improvement of the service. The sorting arrangements
had to be revised frequently, and the extent of the run,
which, as stated above, was originally between Suez and
Bombay, had in 1890 to be curtailed to the voyage
between Aden and Bombay in consequence of the
decision of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to
tranship the outward and homeward mails at Aden every
alternate week.</p>

<p>With the steady increase in the volume of the mails
to be dealt with, it was found necessary to add to this
staff considerably from time to time. In 1873 the total
staff of the six sets comprising the "Marine Postal
Service, Suez and Bombay," was raised to six mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
officers, six assistant mail officers, six supernumerary
assistant mail officers and twelve packers, i.e. five men
for each set. When the journey was curtailed to the
Bombay-Aden run the sets were reduced to three, but
the number in each set had to be steadily increased until
in 1908 it reached twenty-nine, consisting of an assistant
mail officer, fifteen sorters and thirteen packers.</p>

<p>In the year 1899 a special inquiry, made in connection
with a question asked in Parliament as to the
effect of the introduction of Imperial penny postage on
work in the sea post office, revealed the fact that the
conditions of the service were very exacting on the staff.
The extent to which the sorting of the mails could be
done at Bombay or in the Railway Mail Service instead
of at sea was very fully considered, and, although the
Committee of postal officers convened at Bombay to
examine the subject did not recommend the discontinuance
of the existing arrangement, its retention was
made conditional upon the adoption of a number of
special measures to reduce the amount of work at sea.</p>

<p>A further inquiry into the conditions of service in the
sea post office, instituted in the year 1905 in connection
with a representation on the subject made to the Secretary
of State for India by the late Mr. Samuel Smith, M.P.,
again brought into prominence the fact that the work
had to be performed in circumstances of a peculiarly
trying nature. It also established that, owing to the
rapid increase, at the rate of 10 to 12 per cent a year, in
the volume of the mails, the question of arranging for
the sorting work to be done on shore instead of at sea
could not be deferred much longer. This growth was
bound to involve further additions to the staff from time
to time, while the accommodation which it was possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to secure for the work, especially on board the through
mail steamers, was strictly limited.</p>

<p>The subject of abolishing the sea post office altogether,
or, at least, of restricting it to very small proportions,
was again taken up in 1907, as the Postmaster-General,
Bombay, reported that the service could not be placed
on a proper footing without the provision of much more
accommodation on board the through steamers, and
expressed the opinion that the time had come for considering
whether it was not possible to have most of the
work of sorting done on shore.</p>

<p>By the end of 1908 the volume of the mails had
become so large and the difficulty of dealing with them
on board so great that a radical change was needed.
The question of having the sorting work done on shore
was, therefore, fully examined again with the Postmaster-General,
Bombay. The position at the time was
as follows: The mails for India despatched from the
United Kingdom were received by the Aden-Bombay
sea post office partly sorted for the various territorial
divisions of India, and partly unsorted. The unsorted
portion, which amounted to about 40 per cent of the
total, consisted of the articles of all classes posted or
received in London late on Friday evening, which the
London General Post Office did not sort before
despatch. The Indian mails from countries other than
the United Kingdom were received by the sea post
office wholly unsorted. With the exception of trade
circulars and price lists, all the unsorted mails received
were dealt with by the sea post office between Aden and
Bombay. The average number of the unregistered
letters, postcards, newspapers, packets of printed papers,
and samples which had to be sorted by the sea post office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
on each voyage from Aden to Bombay was 150,000 and,
in addition, some 7000 registered articles had to be
specially treated and about 6000 unpaid articles examined
and taxed with postage. This work had to be performed
under very trying conditions and, during the monsoon
season especially, the staff was hard pressed to finish the
sorting before the steamer reached Bombay. The accommodation
for sorting the mails provided on the
through mail steamers was becoming less and less adequate
as the volume of the mail increased and no additional
space could be obtained.</p>

<p>The proposal to meet the situation by again extending
the run of the sea post office to Port Said or Suez had
to be negatived owing to the transhipment at Aden on
alternate weeks. Moreover, it was undesirable to resort
to a measure of this kind, as, quite apart from the large
additional expenditure involved in return for insufficient
advantages, the difficulty of keeping the staff under
close and constant supervision was becoming more pronounced.
In fact, this difficulty of exercising proper
supervision over the enormous volume of work at sea
furnished in itself a very strong argument in favour of
having the work of sorting and dealing with these
important mails done entirely on shore.</p>

<p>It was estimated that, with the provision of all
necessary appliances and conveniences for dealing rapidly
with the work on shore, a staff of about 150 well-trained
and efficient sorters could do within a period of two and a
half hours from the time of the <i>landing</i> of the mails the
whole of the work then done by the sea post office. This
number could be easily provided from among the
sorters already employed in the sea post office, in the
Bombay General Post Office, and in sections of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Railway Mail Service working into and out of Bombay.
The provision of suitable accommodation for the sorting
to be done on shore, which was formerly a matter of
much difficulty owing to the want of space in the
General Post Office, Bombay, no longer existed as the
new General Post Office near the Victoria Terminus,
the building of which was then well advanced, had
ample room for this purpose.</p>

<p>It was unnecessary to enter into any examination of
the question in respect of the outward mails from India
as the whole of the work done by the sea post office
in connection with those mails could just as easily be
performed, without any public or postal inconvenience
and at very little extra cost, by the Railway Mail Service
and in the various large post offices in India.</p>

<p>In view of the increasingly unfavourable conditions
under which the sorting had to be performed at sea and
of the greater security and efficiency that would be
secured by having it done on shore, it was admitted that
the best course would be to abolish the sea sorting
service, but to do so gradually in order to avoid any
dislocation in the disposal of the foreign mails. The
various Indian Chambers of Commerce were consulted
in 1911, and the general opinion was that no change
should be made until the Alexandra Docks at Bombay
were completed. The authorities of the Bombay
Port Trust were accordingly requested to provide a
sorting hall for the Post Office on the new pier. On
the completion of the new mole in the harbour the mail
steamer, instead of discharging its mails in the stream,
would be able to berth alongside the pier; the delay in
transhipment would be greatly reduced, and with a
sufficient staff of sorters on the spot the mails would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
ready for despatch by the special trains due to leave
Bombay within four and a half hours of the signalling
of the steamers.</p>

<p>The question was finally settled by the outbreak of
the War in 1914. The sailings of the mail steamers
became very irregular, accommodation on board could
no longer be provided for sorters, and consequently the
sorting of both the outward and inward mails had to be
performed in the Bombay General Post Office. The
sorting of the homeward mail on shore was undertaken
from the 15th August, 1914, and the last inward mail
sorted on board arrived at Bombay on the 27th August,
1914. In spite of war conditions, the first special train
usually started within seven hours of the steamer having
been signalled. In these circumstances the sea post
office was formally abolished as such, and the Indian
share of the Eastern Mail Service subsidy was reduced
by a sum of £8800 a year on account of its discontinuance.</p>

<p>No other Postal Administration of the world has ever
attempted to undertake the task of sorting the foreign
mails while in course of transit by sea on anything like
the scale on which this work was done by the Indian
Post Office. A certain amount of sorting of mails was
done on the steamers of the White Star Line sailing
between Liverpool and New York, and on those of the
American Line sailing between Southampton and New
York, also on board the German steamers sailing between
Bremen or Hamburg and New York. The work done
on those lines, however, was on a very minor scale and a
small staff of four men on the White Star and American
Line steamers, and of three on the German steamers was
employed. The strength of the staff of the sea post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
office working between Bombay and Aden was, in 1914,
one hundred and three men, divided into three sets of
one assistant mail officer, seventeen sorters and fourteen
packers each, with seven probationary sorters. The
staff was a most extravagant one; the men were not
employed for more than half their time. By using a
large staff and with proper organisation the work that
took five days at sea is now being done more efficiently
in a less number of hours in Bombay.</p>

<p>Under present arrangements the mails are hoisted
from the steamer direct into the Foreign Mail Sorting
Office on the Ballard Pier. There they are opened and
sorted for the various parts of India by about one
hundred and fifty sorters, and within three hours they
are ready for the postal special trains which leave the
pier station for Calcutta, Madras, Lucknow and the
Punjab. Foreign Mail Service sections work in each of
these trains to deal with the final sorting and distribution
of the mails to the various stations <i>en route</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

THE POST OFFICE IN MESOPOTAMIA AND THE PERSIAN GULF</h2>


<p>The Great War has thrown such strong light
on the countries which border on the Persian
Gulf that it may be interesting to record the
important part which has been played by
the Post Office of India in connection with imperial
policy in Persia and Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Owing to political considerations and the necessity of
keeping open alternative means of communication
between Europe and India, the importance of the
Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia as a mail route was
established nearly a century and a half ago. The ships
of the old Indian Navy carried mail packets from Bombay
to Basra, which was the starting-point of a regular
dromedary post to Aleppo, linked with a horse post from
Aleppo to Constantinople, and it is an interesting piece
of history that Lord Nelson's letter to the Bombay
Government, giving the news of the naval victory of the
Nile, was transmitted by this route.</p>

<p>During the first half of the last century, as the Persian
Gulf and the Shat-el-Arab were infested with pirates,
these waters were avoided by British trading vessels, so
that, when a ship of the Indian Navy was not available
to convey mails to Bombay, letters from the Political
Residents of the East India Company stationed at
Bagdad and Basra were sent to India by the desert route<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
via Damascus and Beyrout and thence through Egypt,
and correspondence between Bushire and India had to
be diverted through Teheran and Alexandria. In 1862
a regular six-weekly mail service between Bombay and
Basra was undertaken by the British India Steam Navigation
Company, and about the same time the Euphrates
and Tigris Steam Navigation Company agreed to extend
the mail service from Basra to Bagdad by running their
steamers in connection with the ocean line. The postal
system at the coast ports, however, was defective owing
to the absence of local post offices for the collection and
distribution of mails, but these were gradually established
from the year 1864 onwards at Bushire, Muscat, Bandar
Abas, Bahrain, Mohammerah, and other places under
the protection of British Consular officers, and post
offices were opened at Bagdad and Basra in Turkish
Arabia in 1868.</p>

<p>Although all these post offices were primarily intended
for the benefit of political officers of the Government of
India, they have proved just as useful to the consular
representatives of other European nations and to the
public, and there is no doubt that, by supplying a commercial
want, they gave a great impetus to trade in the
Persian Gulf region. For years there was no other
local postal service worthy of the name, and intercourse
with the hinterland was entirely under the control of
the British Consular officers. In 1868 Turkish Arabia
was wholly dependent for regular communication with
the outside world on English enterprise. There were
two mail routes from Bagdad, one to Teheran via
Kermanshah, a distance of 480 miles, and the other from
Bagdad to Damascus, 500 miles, in connection with the
British Consulate at the latter place and the route to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
England via Beyrout. A monthly mail service was also
maintained by the Government of India for the convenience
of the British Legation at Teheran and the
Residency of Bushire, the route lying through Shiraz
and Ispahan, where British agencies had been established,
but no postage was charged on letters despatched, as the
line was kept up purely for political purposes. In
addition to this post the Indo-European Telegraph
Department had a weekly service from Bushire to
Shiraz. These Persian lines were worked partly by
runners and partly by horsemen, and continued until the
Persian Government inaugurated its own service in 1877
and established a weekly post between Bushire and
Teheran.</p>

<p>The Turkish representative at the International
Postal Congress held at Berne in 1878 urged that all
foreign post offices in the Ottoman dominions should be
suppressed, but the demand was rejected as it involved
a diplomatic question outside the province of the
Congress. In 1881 the Turkish Government established
a dromedary post between Bagdad and Damascus in
opposition to the English consular overland post and,
after repeated representations on the part of the Ottoman
Government, the latter was abolished in 1886 after
having been in existence for upwards of a hundred years.
In the following year the Ottoman Government closed
their own line, and the only direct route left open to
Europe was the Turkish post via Mosul on the Tigris
to Constantinople. When reporting the closing of the
British desert post, the British Consul-General at
Bagdad asked the Postmaster-General in London to
warn the British public not to post anything of value
by any route other than the one from London to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Bombay and thence by sea to Basra and Bagdad, and
the numerous complaints of the loss of parcels, books
and letters fully justified his want of confidence in the
Ottoman post.</p>

<p>The British post offices at Basra and Bagdad and the
service by river steamer between these two ports were
subjected to marked hostility on the part of the Turks,
notwithstanding the continued efforts of the British Consular
officer to limit their functions. Competition with
the local Ottoman postal institutions was never aimed at,
and Indian post offices were primarily and chiefly maintained
for Consular purposes and located in the Consulate
buildings. Local traders, however, were not slow
to discover the advantage of the safe transit offered by
the Indian mail service and the convenience of the parcel
post system, but their efforts to avoid payment of
Customs dues on articles imported by this means were
frustrated at the outset by the British Consul-General of
Bagdad, Sir Arnold Kemball, who went so far as to
suspend the parcel traffic in the interests of the Turkish
Government until the latter could make adequate provision
for Custom-House examination and levying of
dues on both import and export parcels. After various
methods of detecting and dealing with dutiable parcels
had been tried for many years, the system of handing
over all inward parcels received from the offices of exchange
at Bombay, Karachi and Bushire to the Turkish
Customs at Bagdad and Basra with copies of the Customs
declarations and invoices received was adopted by the
Consular post offices, the addressees being required to
take delivery at the Customs House on presentation
of a delivery order signed by the British-Indian postmaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Anyone who has had experience of the vagaries of
Turkish Customs House officials can sympathize with
people whose goods fell into their hands. The smallest
irregularity, however unintentional, detected in a declaration
or manifest could only be set right by the liberal
distribution of bribes. Woe betide the scrupulous owner
or consignee who declined to adopt such methods and
decided instead to stand by his rights and carry his complaint
to higher authorities. The story is told of a young
missionary lady whose wedding outfit was packed into a
box which was taken in custody by a Turkish official and
was detained for the ostensible purpose of examination
of the contents and assessment of duty. The settlement
of this knotty point proceeded in a leisurely fashion for
weeks, because the owner's conscience or purse would not
permit of her speedily clinching the matter by a suitable
payment. When the box was finally delivered the
addressee found, to her horror, that the wedding dress
and other articles of her trousseau bore unmistakable
traces of having been worn. To add insult to injury, the
Customs authorities threatened to confiscate the goods,
saying that there was a prohibition against the importation
of "worn clothes"! There is no doubt that they
had been freely used by the harem of some Ottoman
Customs official, as the curiosity of Turkish ladies regarding
the latest European fashions was notorious and
could usually overcome official scruples.</p>

<p>When the Inland Insurance system was introduced in
India in 1877 it was extended to the post offices in the
Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia. The Insured Parcel
Post was used largely by traders at Bagdad, Basra and
Bushire for the exportation of specie, and the total value
insured in 1882-83 amounted to over twenty-four lakhs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of rupees. The pearl merchants at Bahrain, which is the
centre of the pearl fisheries in the Gulf, availed themselves
largely of the Insured Parcels Post for the export
of valuable parcels of pearls. Protests were soon lodged
by the British India Steam Navigation Company, which
held the mail contract, against this competition on the
part of the Post Office on the ground that it infringed
their monopoly. They argued that the carriage of specie
and pearls was almost the sole source of profit from the
Persian Gulf service, and after a careful review of the
whole question it was decided in 1885 to abolish insurance
of parcels and letters to and from the British post offices
in the Gulf and Turkish Arabia. This measure resulted
in a heavy loss in postal revenue, but was only fair to a
Company which had risked much in maintaining British
trade relations with that part of the world, and which
has done more than any other to throttle German competition.</p>

<p>The steamship companies employed to carry mails have
all along had to contend with serious difficulties at the
Gulf ports. The original mail service undertaken by the
British India Steam Navigation Company between Bombay
and Basra, and by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam
Navigation Company between Basra and Bagdad, was a
six-weekly one, but a monthly service was arranged in
1866 and a fortnightly service in 1870. From 1878 onwards
mails were despatched weekly in both directions,
and this has been supplemented in recent years by a fast
service in connection with the English mail, the steamers
calling only at the principal intermediate ports. There
were many obstacles to speedy transit and delivery of
mails, such as absence of lights and buoys, want of
harbour facilities at the Persian ports, difficulties of navigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in the river Tigris during the dry season, obstruction
on the part of the authorities, especially the Turks,
and difficulty of obtaining regular labour at the various
anchorages. At many places the mail steamers have to
anchor far out in the roadstead, and in rough weather
there is some risk and delay in landing and embarking
mails. The mail contract with the British India Steam
Navigation Company required that mails should be exchanged
during daylight, and three hours were specified
for the purpose; but this condition could not always be
observed, and it was in the power of the local postmaster
to upset all arrangements. Unrest was a common feature
of the political life of these parts, especially when there
was a change of Governors, and the authorities were
generally too feeble to cope with a rising among the Arab
or Persian tribes without the assistance of British bluejackets
or Indian troops, who were not always available
on the spot. At such times the Indian postmaster used
to shut up his office long before darkness set in and
barricade himself and his mails in the inner rooms of
the building, so that the ship's mail officer arriving at
dusk had no easy task in getting access to him. On one
occasion the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf, whose
word is law in these regions, was a passenger by the mail
steamer which arrived at a certain port on a very sultry
summer evening. Being anxious that the steamer should
sail to Karachi without unnecessary delay, he asked the
captain to expedite its departure, and the latter, who had
previous experience of the local post office, said that he
had his doubts about receiving the mails before morning,
but promised to try his best, and went ashore himself.
Two hours later a message came to the ship asking for
the Political Resident's personal assistance, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
nothing left for the distinguished official to do but to go
to the office himself. He found the captain and his
second officer pelting the roof of the post office with
stones, while from inside issued forth the vilest abuse of
all ships' captains and their relations, with threats to
report the attack to the Resident. The matter was
eventually settled, and the story is still told by all the
natives with great gusto, as the Eastern mind sees a
special humour in the setting down of an important
official.</p>

<p>The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company,
owned by Messrs. Lynch Brothers, during the many years
of its existence was never able to obtain permission from
the Ottoman Government to run more than two steamers
between Basra and Bagdad. The distance is five hundred
miles, and, as the paddle-boats had occasionally to tie up
during the night when the river was low, it is not surprising
that the weekly mail service each way had no
reputation for regularity. There were several other causes
which contributed to misconnection between these boats
and the ocean-going mail steamers of the British India
Company. The run from Basra to Bagdad and vice versa
was usually accomplished in five days, which left only two
days at either end for loading and unloading, cleaning and
repairs of engines and other duties. If a steamer reached
port towards the end of the week, little or no work could
be done. Friday is a general holiday among the Turks and
Arabs who are Mohammedans, and the Customs House is
kept closed; Saturday is the Hebrew Sabbath, when
Jews are absent from the wharves; while Sunday is a
<i>dies non</i> with the Armenian Christians, who are among
the most important of the shippers. It was hard for an
European merchant to contend with such an accumulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of sacred days. He was willing to keep open and
work on every day of the week, but the susceptibilities
of the local population cannot be overridden. The
Turkish Government tried every conceivable method of
hindering the enterprise of Messrs. Lynch and Company,
but their steamers continued to flourish and gain in popularity,
whereas the Ottoman line of steamers, established
in 1867 under the auspices of the Government with the
avowed object of smashing the British line, failed to
justify its existence. The Turkish steamers were badly
equipped and inefficiently controlled, and being always
in a state of dilapidation became a byword of reproach
even among the Turkish subjects of Mesopotamia. It
was not surprising, therefore, that overtures on the part
of this Company to obtain the English contract for the
carriage of mails were never seriously considered. Apart
from the unreliability of the service, there were strong
political grounds for supporting the Company which had
done so much under the British flag to open up the
commerce of Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Originally the merchants at the intermediate river
ports of Kurnah, Kut and Amara, on the Tigris, were
accustomed to post letters on the river mail boats and
the clerk on board acted as a sort of travelling postmaster,
but it was not long before the Turkish authorities
raised objections to this practice as an infringement
of their postal rights, notwithstanding that they had a
concession of free carriage of Turkish official correspondence
through the British Post. After much correspondence
and discussion between the Indian Political and
Postal authorities it was decided not to allow the mail
steamer to be used as a post office. Consequently all
letters posted on board were made over to the Ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
post offices, and this procedure was also followed in respect
of local postings in the British post offices at Basra
and Bagdad for all places in Turkish Arabia.</p>

<p>The purely Consular status of the Post Office in the
Persian Gulf region was shown by the fact that our mail
bags for Bagdad were always labelled "H.M.'s Consul-General,
Bagdad," and those for Basra directed to
"H.M.'s Consul," special seals with the Royal Arms being
used. The British Indian postmasters at these places
held no written communication with Turkish officials,
and the rule was that all such correspondence should pass
through the Consul or Consul-General. Service privileged
correspondence between Turkish Government departments,
if properly franked, was allowed to pass free
of postage through our post offices at Bagdad and Basra,
and registered letters or packets suspected to contain
precious stones, jewellery and other valuables liable to
duty were transferred to the local Customs House.</p>

<p>The Indian Post Office in Mesopotamia and the
Persian Gulf was not only the handmaiden of British
commercial enterprise for many years, but also helped in
an unostentatious way to consolidate our position and
influence in those regions. Over thirty years ago a
Persian Gulf division was formed under the control of
an European Superintendent who had to supervise and
visit the offices regularly. The postmasters are either
Indian Christians, Mohammedans or Hindus, and they are
invested by the backward and unenlightened inhabitants
of the remote Gulf ports with mysterious powers as the
representatives of the great Indian Government. Wild-looking
Central Asian traders armed with dagger and
pistol, who bring down camel-loads of carpets, dried fruit
and other merchandise from the interior of Persia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the Mekran; courtly and picturesque Arab horse-dealers
who ship their thoroughbreds to Bombay every
year; sleek Persians in their sky-blue tunics; emancipated
negro slaves&mdash;all trust the postmaster in matters
relating to their private business as they would never
trust one of their own kind. The arrival of the weekly
mail at a Persian Gulf port is like a festival. The precincts
of the post office are thronged with a large and
motley crowd drawn from all grades of the populace.
Letters are delivered on the premises on this day, and
everyone who has any link with the outer world is present
on the off-chance of getting a communication through
the post. The postmaster or his munshi stands at an open
window calling out the addresses on the letters, the owners
holding up their hands when they hear their names
called. Most letters are prefixed with the word "Haji,"
which denotes that the recipients are good Mohammedans
who have made the pilgrimage to the Prophet's tomb at
Mecca. The deep, guttural Arabic or the soft Persian
response is occasionally broken by a reply in the more
familiar Hindustani or Gujrati, for in each Gulf port
there is a small colony of Hindu traders from the West
coast of India, easily distinguishable by their alert and
business-like appearance. Women are conspicuous by their
absence&mdash;more so, in fact, than in other Eastern countries&mdash;but,
after the crowd has dispersed, a closely veiled
and sheeted figure occasionally glides to the window and
in plaintive tones asks for some service, the performance
of which she must personally see to in the absence of her
lord and master from home.</p>

<p>The Great War completely altered the conditions in
Mesopotamia. In consequence of the Turkish Government
having ordered the closure of all foreign post offices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
within their territory, the Indian post offices at Bagdad
and Basra were closed under protest on the 1st October,
1914. The sub-postmaster, Basra, continued at work
settling the affairs of his office until the 27th October,
1914, and left for India next day, whereas the Postmaster,
Bagdad, was made a prisoner on the outbreak of
hostilities with Turkey on the 1st November, 1914, and
the post office property in his charge fell into the hands
of the Turks.</p>

<p>The formal entry into Basra by British troops was made
on the 23rd November, 1914, and the postal service was
undertaken by the Indian Field Post Office. The service
was developed and extended as the troops advanced. A
railway was constructed from Basra to Amara and from
Kut-el-Amara to Bagdad, and a regular mail service has
been introduced by river steamers between Amara and
Kut-el-Amara. The transit time of mails between Basra
and Bagdad has thus been reduced to two days. Excellent
jetties have now been built at Basra, so that much
time is saved in loading and unloading mails, and, with
well-equipped post offices at all important places, the
postal service of Mesopotamia has become quite efficient.</p>

<p>Since the Armistice in 1918 the Indian Field Post
Offices have been gradually withdrawn and have been replaced
by civil offices under a Civil Director of Postal
Services. The occupied territory in Mesopotamia is
known as Iraq, and Turkish postage stamps overprinted
with the words "Iraq under British Occupation" were
introduced in 1918. On the 1st May, 1919, the Military
Director of Postal Services was withdrawn and the postal
administration of the country handed over to the Civil
Director, who is now an official of the Local Government.
A few Indian field post offices are still retained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
for the troops stationed beyond the frontiers of Iraq,
but these will be closed as soon as military operations
are finished.</p>

<p>The first Civil Director of the Post Office of Iraq was
Mr. C. J. E. Clerici, an officer of the Indian Establishment.
Almost the whole staff consists of men from the
Post Office of India, and will continue to do so until local
men have been trained in postal work. Indian inland
postage rates were at first charged for correspondence
exchanged between India and Iraq, but from the 1st
September, 1919, the British Imperial foreign rates of
postage were introduced. With the exception of four
post offices on the Persian Gulf&mdash;namely, Koweit,
Abadan, Mohammerah and Ahwaz, which are being
administered by Iraq&mdash;the other Indian post offices in
the Persian Gulf area are still under the control of the
Post Office of India.</p>

<p>Such is the history of the establishment of the Indian
Post Office in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf region.
It began with the opening of small offices for the British
Consular Agencies and commercial establishments of the
East India Company. The public, however, were not
slow to take advantage of the means of communication
thus provided, and, despite the strenuous opposition of
the Ottoman Empire, a really efficient postal system was
organized. The extension of the Bagdad Railway, the
Euphrates Valley irrigation project and the opening of
the Anglo-Persian oil field, whose pipe-line terminates on
the Shat-el-Arab, are the three great factors in the development
of Mesopotamia. This country already occupies
a prominent place in the affairs of the Empire, and,
situated, as it is, on a main highway between East and
West, it is possible that the region, which was the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and cradle of the earliest civilization of the world, will
recover its old importance. When this has been achieved
the Post Office of India will always be able to look back
with pride on the pioneer work which it has done in its
quiet, unassuming way during the past half century.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

THE POST OFFICE DURING THE INDIAN MUTINY</h2>


<p>Every student of the history of the Indian
Mutiny of 1857 knows the part played by the
Indian Telegraph Department during that
great crisis. The famous telegram of warning
which was transmitted to the principal stations in the
Punjab by two young signallers of the Delhi office
(Messrs. Brendish and Pilkington) upon their own initiative
on the morning of the 11th May, 1857, when the
Meerut rebels, flushed with success, crossed the bridge of
boats over the Jumna and entered the city of Delhi to
join hands with their comrades there, is a splendid example
of an assumption of responsibility followed by
prompt action. Sir Herbert Edwardes refers to the final
telegraphic message sent by Brendish to Mr. Montgomery,
the Judicial Commissioner at Lahore, in these
terms:</p>

<p>"When the mutineers came over from Meerut and
were cutting the throats of the Europeans in every part
of the Cantonment, a boy, employed in the telegraph
office at Delhi, had the presence of mind to send off a
message to Lahore to Mr. Montgomery, the Judicial
Commissioner, to tell him that the mutineers had arrived
and had killed this civilian and that officer, and wound
up his message with the significant words 'we're off.'
That was the end of the message. Just look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
courage and sense of duty which made that little boy,
with shots and cannon all round him, manipulate that
message, which, I do not hesitate to say, was the means
of the salvation of the Punjab."</p>

<p>In the General Report of the Telegraph Department
for the year 1857-58 the Director-General remarked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The value of that last service of the Delhi office is
best described in the words of Montgomery: 'The
electric telegraph has saved India.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Excellent work was also done by Post Office officials
during the Indian Mutiny, but unfortunately it is forgotten
owing to its having received little historical recognition.
A perusal of musty records which lie in the
archives of the Indian Government reveals a record of
duties well performed in the midst of insuperable difficulties
and dangers of which the Department may well
be proud.</p>

<p>At the time of the Mutiny the British Army in India
was deficient in the organization of two branches indispensable
to the success of military operations in the field,
and it was left to the Post Office to supply the want to a
considerable extent. The Intelligence and Transport Departments
were in their infancy, and the military authorities
were not slow to take advantage of facilities afforded
by the Post Office. At the commencement of the outbreak
it was evident that postmasters in the affected
districts were in a position to keep the authorities accurately
informed of the direction in which the rebellion
was spreading and to report the movements of the
mutineers as long as the postal lines of communication
remained intact, especially in the districts where there
were no telegraph lines or where the wires had been cut.
Many officials&mdash;European, Eurasian and Indian&mdash;were
killed at the outset, post offices being looted and destroyed
and mails intercepted on the various lines wherever
the rebels were in power. Much valuable information
regarding such occurrences was collected and passed
on to the authorities by postal employés in remote places.
For transport, the Army had ready at hand, on the trunk
roads of India, the machinery of the Post Office horse
transit and bullock train, which was then in a high state
of efficiency, and was able to render incalculable service
in connection with the forward movement of troops and
munitions of war as well as the despatch down country
of wounded officers and men&mdash;and of refugees when the
campaign was well advanced. After the final Relief of
Lucknow by Sir Colin Campbell many of the ladies and
children of the garrison were conveyed by this means in
safety to Calcutta.</p>

<p>The Sepoy Mutiny began at Meerut on the 10th May,
1857. From the 18th May, 1857, onwards telegrams and
letters were received at the Director-General's headquarters
in Calcutta from the postmasters at Allahabad,
Benares, Umballa and other stations, reporting the stoppage
of mail communication with places which had fallen
into the hands of the mutineers. News was also thus
given of the destruction of post offices and plunder of
mails at Sitapore, Indore, Hirapore, Cawnpore, Shahazadpore,
Daryabad, Saugor, Segombe, Hamirpur, Jaunpor,
Azimgarh and many more places. On the 15th May,
1857, the Postmaster-General, North-Western Provinces,
gave instructions to his postmasters to collect waggons
and bullocks for the conveyance of troops. On the 21st
May the Postmaster, Agra, reported to the Director-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that Dr. Clark, who had been specially vested
with the authority of Postmaster-General in a portion of
the North-Western Provinces, was safe and well at
Muttra, and was trying to open mail communication.
On the 26th May, 1857, the Postmaster, Benares, applied
to the Director-General for authority to supply horses for
conveyance of troops. Mr. H. B. Riddell, Director-General
at the time, was fully alive to the situation and
set a brilliant example to all ranks. He addressed the
following letter to the Government of India from his
camp at Sherghotty on the 30th May, 1857:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have the honour to report that arrangements have
been made or are in train which will, I trust, enable the
Bullock Train establishment to convey daily without interruption
one hundred men from Raneegunge to
Benares. There will be fifty-six pairs of Bullocks at each
stage between Sherghotty and Benares.</p>

<p>"The Bullocks procurable are of the smallest and most
miserable description....
A workshop will be established at Dehree and, as the road
over the sand of the Soane will be broken up in a day or
two, the men of each detachment will be conveyed over
in country carts, fresh waggons being ready on the other
side. I shall probably have to stay to-morrow and make
some arrangements at the Soane, but will, after doing so,
move on to Benares and arrange for the despatch of
troops from Benares to Allahabad. If the Commissariat
bullocks are stationed along the line and they have any
covered carts, large detachments can be sent every two
or three days, but I will telegraph what can be done when
I reach Benares. In the meantime Commissariat Gun
bullocks should be stationed along the line."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The Director-General's efforts were ably seconded by
Mr. C. K. Dove, Postmaster-General, and Mr. Garrett,
Deputy Postmaster-General of Bengal, both of whom did
all in their power to ensure the prompt despatch of troops
up country, calling in the aid of the local magistrates to
secure the best cattle and the services of the Engineering
Department to facilitate the passage of carts over unbridged
rivers along the Grand Trunk Road.</p>

<p>On the 2nd July, 1857, it was arranged to place the
whole of the Bullock Train establishment north of
Benares at the disposal of the military authorities. The
transfer was made at the instance of General Havelock,
who had just assumed command of the troops at Allahabad.
He decided to use the Bullock Train entirely for
the transport of stores and ammunition to the front and,
when the rains had broken and the rivers became navigable,
to convey troops by river steamers, a far more
convenient and expeditious means than road conveyance.
When it was necessary to use the roads, elephants were
provided by the Commissary-General at Calcutta and by
local zemindars (landholders).</p>

<p>On the 29th July, 1857, the Government of India
published a notification authorizing the Chief Covenanted
Civil or Military officer at every station throughout India
where there was a post office under a Deputy Postmaster
and no resident Postmaster had been specially appointed,
to assume the office of Postmaster or to assign the office
to some other Covenanted Civil or Military Officer at
the station, reporting the arrangement in each instance
for the information of the Postmaster-General of the
Presidency. The Deputy Postmaster was to perform
duties connected with the post office under the orders
of the Postmaster so appointed. The functions of Inspecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Postmasters remained unaffected by this order,
and post offices at places where there was no covenanted
Civil or Military Officer were left in charge of the
Deputy Postmasters. These orders were necessitated by
the interruption of mail communication between many
post offices and their head-quarters and the difficulty of
control being exercised by Postmasters-General who were
not always in a position to issue prompt instructions to
their subordinates in matters of importance or emergency.
At the same time no general power of censorship over
correspondence was granted to officers, nor was anything
done to diminish public confidence in the Government
mail service.</p>

<p>Reports regarding the plunder of mails continued to
come in from places as far removed as Kolhapur in the
Southern Mahratta country and Bahraich in the United
Provinces. Mails between Bengal and the United
Provinces on one side and the Punjab on the other had
to be diverted via Bombay, the Commissioner of Sind
taking the responsibility for their safe despatch through
Hyderabad (Sind). Many of the reports from postmasters
referred to fresh outbreaks, and the movements
of mutineers who did not hesitate to remove dak horses
from relay stations on the mail routes whenever they
had the chance. The information contained in these
letters was duly passed on to the military authorities.</p>

<p>In connection with the correspondence for the army
in the field, post offices were organized to accompany the
movable columns under General Havelock, the Malwa
Field Force and later the divisions commanded by
General Outram and other distinguished leaders. During
the campaign soldiers' letters were exempt from forward
postage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The large tract of country known as the North-Western
Provinces and Oudh was the focus of the disturbance
of 1857, and the strain put upon the postal
officials in those provinces was greater than in other
affected parts of the country. Most of the post offices
and mail lines had to be closed at the beginning of the
outbreak and were reopened one by one, as order was
gradually restored by the British forces. A most interesting
narrative of the interruption in the mail arrangements
in the North-Western Provinces and Punjab
subsequent to the outbreak at Meerut and Delhi on the
10th and 11th May, 1857, was supplied by Mr. Paton,
Postmaster-General, and will be found in Appendix G.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the outbreak of the Mutiny
caused a complete disorganization of postal communications,
and the task of restoring mail lines in hostile territory
was no easy one. The pay offered by the Department
was not sufficient to induce men to risk their lives in
isolated places, which were always open to attacks by the
mutineers or by bands of armed villagers, and it is characteristic
of the Indian Government at the time that
they expected men to serve for salaries which were
admitted to be inadequate even in times of peace. I will
quote extracts from the reports of the Postmasters-General
of the North-Western Provinces, Bengal and
Bombay, which throw an interesting light upon the
difficulties with which the Post Office had to contend in
these troublous times.</p>

<p>Report of the Postmaster-General, North-Western
Provinces, for the year ending the 31st March, 1858:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In consequence of the rebellion, the Post Offices and
lines of postal communication in the North-Western
Provinces and Oudh were closed more or less, nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>throughout the year under review, and many of those in
Oude and Bundelkund have not yet been reopened,
owing to a portion of the above Provinces being still in
the hands of the rebels, so that a report of the transactions
of the present year is chiefly a narrative of the
effects of the disturbances on the Post Office Department,
The results shown herein cannot therefore be fairly compared
with those of the previous years.</p>

<p>"The number of complaints of the loss and missending
of letters during the year under review is comparatively
greater than many of the previous years, which
is chiefly owing to the frequent loss of the mails on
different lines of road by rebels, their transmission by
circuitous routes from the direct lines being closed or unsafe,
and their irregular despatch by inexperienced hands
employed in the Camp Post Offices.</p>

<p>"The proportion of bearing to paid or stamped
letters is 0.974 to 1, which shows a progressive increase
in the number of the former. This may be fairly
attributed to the general habit of the natives, especially
those in the army, and also among lower classes to despatch
their letters bearing, more particularly at this
period, when, from the constant movements of the troops
from one place to another and the disturbed state of the
country, they are undoubtedly liable to miscarry.</p>

<p>"I may also observe that a very large number of letters
posted by the military and lower classes of the people are
intended for places in the interior of districts, and, as
the District Post establishments have not yet been fully
reorganized, there is no guarantee for their punctual or
safe delivery. Natives, being real economists, naturally
prefer the despatch of their letters bearing, and so prevent
any loss from prepayment of postage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<p>"The staff of the Department was much reduced by
casualties during the late mutinies, and much difficulty
has been experienced in procuring properly qualified
persons to accept employment. A large number of offices
having had to be hastily reopened, the demand for
English-speaking clerks has been unprecedented, and,
without raising the salaries, I could not fill up the
vacancies in the Post Office.</p>

<p>"It is not a matter of surprise that extraordinary difficulty
has been experienced in reorganizing the Post Office
in such a crisis, when it is recollected that the salaries
allowed to the officers of the Department are on a scale
below that generally obtained in other Departments, that
there are no holidays allowed them, and that leave of
absence, excepting on medical certificate, is in a measure
prohibited, owing to the establishment being generally
on such a minimum scale as not to admit of any one being
absent without providing a trained substitute.</p>

<p>"But notwithstanding an increase to the salaries of the
officials having been generally granted to the extent that
I have represented as necessary, I regret to have to record
that I have not yet been able to complete the revision of
all the office establishments to my satisfaction. There
are still many incompetent officials in the Department,
whom I am obliged to tolerate, until I meet with better
qualified persons to take their places.</p>

<p>"As might be expected from an inexperienced or untrained
establishment, working under great disadvantages,
a comparatively large number of complaints of the missending
and loss of letters have been received during the
year under review, and, though every care has been taken
to prevent mistakes, yet, from the circumstance of the
direction on letters being often hastily and illegibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>written, and the army, in numerous detached parties,
constantly in the field, without their locality or destination
being correctly known to the Post Office, the percentage
of missent covers for the troops has unavoidably
been great.</p>

<p>"I have again to remark the increase in the number of
bearing letters; but considering the unsettled state of
these Provinces, it is only what might be expected. I
need not here repeat the reasons which induce the non-commercial
class of natives to send their letters bearing
postage.</p>

<p>"Taking into consideration the variety of languages
in which native letters are generally written, and the very
careless and illegible manner in which the directions and
the names of addressees and senders are given, I am of
opinion that the proportion disposed of at my office
(being about 33 per cent on the whole number received)
is satisfactory."</p></blockquote>

<p>Report of the Postmaster-General, Bengal, for the
year 1857-58:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The mutinies which broke out in the North-Western
Provinces in May, 1857, were also felt during the past
year in the Bengal Presidency, and parts of the province
were more or less affected by them, but, happily for
Bengal, the interruptions and disorganization to her Postal
Department caused by them were, by the adoption of
prompt and vigorous measures, speedily restored. The
Post Office Department, however, did not escape&mdash;a
Deputy Postmaster and an Overseer were killed, a runner
was wounded, a number of post offices, especially in Behar,
were plundered, and a number of mails and mail packets
were seized and destroyed by the mutinous sepoys.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<p>"The rebellion of Koer Sing and the mutinies of the
Dinapore sepoys interrupted and closed for a short time
a portion of the Grand Trunk Road between Saseram and
Benares, and the insurgents carried off some cattle belonging
to the Department, and also burnt down some dak
bungalows above Sherghotty.</p>

<p>"The revolt of the hill tribes on the southern line in
the neighbourhood of Sumbulpore disturbed the communication
with Bombay via Sumbulpore, which had
been opened after the interruption of communication
with Bombay by the Jubbulpore road, and the rebellion
of the Ramghur Battalion disorganized the daks for a
while in the South-West Frontier Agency between Chota
Nagpore and Chyebassa.</p>

<p>"The mutinies of the Chittagong sepoys and the
Segowlee insurgents caused only the destruction of some
packets that fell into their hands, but passed off without
any serious interruption to any mail line in Bengal."</p></blockquote>

<p>Report of the Postmaster-General, Bombay, for the
year 1857-58:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The mutinies imperilled and interrupted almost
every line in the Presidency; the foot lines were obliged
to be strengthened, diverted, abandoned and reopened
as circumstances required; those most severely tried
were in Malwa, Rajpootana, Khandeish, Berar, the
Southern Mahratta country and Guzerat, on some of
which double pay and double numbers were scarcely
sufficient to keep them open, and it was only by the
activity, local knowledge, morale and reliance of the inspecting
officers (always supported strongly by the Civil
officers), whose powers were discretionally enlarged by
me, that the lines were sustained.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is remarkable that in the midst of universal disturbance
(especially in Malwa and Rajpootana), when
distrust and confusion were at their height, and opportunities
for plunder were frequent, and detection next to
impossible, only one case occurred, or rather was brought
home, in which the carriers of the mails either personally
plundered or wilfully destroyed them.</p>

<p>"Although animosity was directed against the servants
of the Post Office in common with every class of persons
in Government employ, it was not especially so in this
Presidency against the Post Office, unless where the collections
offered temptation, as at Indore, Erinpoora,
Neemuch and Mundessore, which offices were assailed
and gutted.</p>

<p>"The knowledge that other lines of post either existed
or would assuredly be established, and that no efforts
would be left unemployed to effect free postal intercourse
whenever required, possibly pointed to the futility
of a general crusade against post runners. Nevertheless,
both as a precaution against disappointment and as
removing a source of temptation, banghy parcels were
discontinued for four months, from July until November.</p>

<p>"The only lines which have been permanently closed
are four branch lines in Malwa.</p>

<p>"That no coercion was used, and that the post was
kept open (it is true by circuitous routes, but still open)
all through this postal range, is strong evidence that the
feeling of the country was not unfavourable to British
authority; it was found that whenever a road was impracticable,
it was rendered so only from fear of the acts
of rebels, upon whose departure or overthrow the post
line was again opened.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Exempt as the post carriers have been from concurrence
in the general insurrection, the conduct of the
other descriptions of postal servants has been not less
good, with the exception of those attached to the Indore
post office. There the temptation of plunder excited an
overseer and peon, and the people of the workshop, to
join in plundering the post office and premises, and one
kitmutgar (table servant), a Mussulman at Samwere,
near Oojein, hounded on some miscreants to murder an
European serjeant from Mahidpore, who took refuge in
it, for which he was subsequently hanged, and the others
transported.</p>

<p>"In the higher grades, the conduct of the postal
officers has been very exemplary; no instance has
occurred in which a postmaster either deserted his post,
or has been suspected of having made use of his position
to give information, to open letters, or to favour in any
way the rebel cause.</p>

<p>"Ten travellers' bungalows and seven post offices
have been burned down, and ten evacuated, of which
three only have remained closed. This does not represent
the extent of injury done, or loss occasioned, the
destruction of stamps, and in other ways by the carrying
away of mail carts, destruction of property, and loss in
postage collection, and compensation to people in postal
employ for good behaviour, or for personal suffering."</p></blockquote>

<p>The success of the postal arrangements during the
Mutiny is largely due to the organization and example of
Mr. Riddell, the Director-General, who attended to all
important matters personally. He was assisted by the
loyal devotion of the entire staff, and the men whose
names may be mentioned for special services are Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Dove, officiating Postmaster-General, Bengal; Mr.
Bennett, Mr. Wallace and Mr. McGowan, of the Bengal
establishment; Lala Salig Ram in the North-Western
Provinces; Dr. Clark and Mr. H. A. Brown in Agra;
Captain Fanshawe and Babu Eshan Chander Mookerjee
in Aligarh; Mr. Taylor in the Deccan and Babu Sheo
Pershad in Delhi. Where so many did well it seems invidious
to mention only a few names, and the President
in Council, when thanking the Director-General for the
work done by the Post Office during the crisis, expressed
the high opinion which the Government entertained of
the services rendered by all the officers of the Department,
European and Indian, in circumstances of the
greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>Enough has been written to show the nature of the
help given to the Indian Empire by the staff of the Post
Office during the Mutiny. It is a record of loyalty and
devotion to duty of which the Department may well be
proud.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

THE INDIAN FIELD POST OFFICE</h2>


<p>In a country where there is seldom perfect peace
it is only natural that the Post Office must accustom
itself to war conditions, and the Field
Postal Service has been a feature of the Indian
Post Office for more than sixty years. During that period
there have been over forty wars and expeditions, extending
from Burma to the Mediterranean, and, as postal
arrangements were required for the forces engaged, the
Field Post Office system in India has been gradually developed
and perfected, and is now recognized as an
important part of the military organization of the
country.</p>

<p>Field Post Office arrangements used to be in the hands
of the Postmaster-General of the Punjab, and he maintained
lists of men willing to serve. In 1918, however,
owing to the wide distribution of the postal staff in
various parts of the world, it was found necessary to
bring the Field Post organization under the immediate
control of the Director-General. When an expedition is
announced, the forces of the Post Office are immediately
mobilized according to the strength of the field army,
and, as the staff required for a brigade and division has
been settled by long experience, no time is lost in getting
the necessary number of men to the assembling stations.</p>

<p>The regulations for the working of Field Post Offices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
are laid down in the Indian Field Service Manual and
the Postal Manual (War), two handbooks issued by the
Indian Army Department; and a complete equipment
of tents and furniture, sufficient for three base post
offices, fifty first-class and twenty second-class field offices,
and for the use of the supervisory staff, is kept at Lahore
ready for immediate despatch. When the Department
has to make its own arrangements for the carriage of
mails between the base post office and the field offices,
overseers are employed to supervise the transit. The
establishment laid down for a base office is one postmaster,
two deputy or assistant postmasters, fifteen clerks
and ten menials, but these numbers must necessarily vary
with the number of field offices required with the different
units.</p>

<p>Postal officials in the field are subject to full military
discipline under the Army Act. Superior officers wear
field service khaki uniform with badges of rank and the
letters "Post" in brass on the shoulders. A Deputy
Postmaster-General or Assistant Director-General of the
Post Office ranks as a Lieutenant-Colonel, and a Superintendent
as Major, Captain or Lieutenant, according to
his grade and length of service. Subordinate officials, if
Europeans, are classed as Assistant Commissaries, Sub-Conductors
or Sergeants, according to their pay, and
Indians are given rank as Subadars, Jemadars, Havildars
or Naiks. Field allowances, in addition to pay, are fixed
according to a sanctioned scale, the rate for a Director
or Superintendent being 25 per cent of his pay, subject
to a minimum monthly allowance of Rs.100 in the case
of the latter. Inspectors and Postmasters draw Rs.90 a
month in addition to pay, other subordinates being remunerated
at a lower rate. In virtue of the military rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
held by them, officers and subordinates are entitled to all
privileges and advantages for service in the field, such as
wound pensions, family pensions, medals and compensation
for loss of baggage.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of field post offices is attached to
the head-quarters of an Expeditionary Force as adviser to
the Military Authorities on all postal matters; he is required
to visit the base and field post offices as frequently
as possible, and is responsible for the proper working and
efficiency of mail arrangements. He arranges with headquarters
for carriage of mails between the base and the
field, fixes the hours of despatch of mails from all post
offices and the hours during which money orders are
issued, and also settles the question of making over cash
collections to the nearest Field Paymaster, Treasure Chest
Officer, Regimental Accounts Officer or Post Commandant,
as the case may be.</p>

<p>The development of the Field Postal System has been
gradual and has undergone many changes. The earliest
record of a regular Indian Post Office staff proceeding for
active service with a military force is in connection with
the Persian Expedition of 1856. The establishment consisted
of two clerks, an interpreter (moonshee) and four
peons, and, as no suitable departmental officer could be
found to take charge of the arrangements, the Government
of Bombay appointed the Military Paymaster of the
Persian Expeditionary Force to take control.</p>

<p>The work accomplished by the Post Office during the
Indian Mutiny has been described in a separate chapter.
Every office situated within the wide area of the disturbances
or on the line of march of the troops performed the
functions of a field post office, the control of the arrangements
devolving on the chief local civil or military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
authority in places where there was no departmental
officer of sufficient seniority or rank to hold charge. The
great services rendered by the Post Office horse transit
and bullock train establishments to the Army were a
prominent feature of the campaign. Separate field post
offices accompanied the moving columns under Generals
Havelock, Outram, Campbell, Hugh Rose, Hope Grant
and other leaders. Twenty years later, when the Afghan
war broke out, the Army had again to rely on the Post
Office for the transport of mails and military stores for
hundreds of miles through the Khyber and Bolan passes
into Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The extension of the railways to the frontiers of India
has put an end to this branch of postal enterprise. Mail
tonga lines worked by contractors still flourish on routes
where there are no railways, but they are being gradually
supplanted by motor conveyances.</p>

<p>A scheme under which the Post Office should maintain
a large number of motor mail vans, which could be used
in time of war for military transport, has already been
suggested, and it is one well worth consideration. An
arrangement of this kind should go far towards solving
the problem of maintaining transport in times of peace,
and should prove advantageous and economical to both
the Army and the Post Office.</p>

<p>The success of the Indian Field Post Office in the
numerous wars and expeditions in which it has been
employed can be vouched for by the reports of commanding
officers. Experience has been bought by long practice,
and the Department never loses an opportunity
of training its staff for military service. At the great
military man&oelig;uvres which are frequently held during the
cold weather in India the troops engaged are always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
accompanied by field post offices fully equipped for war
conditions, with the result that there is always a large
body of men in the Post Office thoroughly trained in this
kind of work. On field service the postal official is
"Nobody's child." He has to fend for himself, and,
although transport is told off for the conveyance of camp
equipment and mails, it is seldom forthcoming when required.
The Army Head-quarters Staff looks after its
own post office, but is inclined to regard the others as an
encumbrance, and this attitude has developed a faculty
of "slimness" in the field postal officer, which he uses
for defeating military regulations. He has become an
expert in stealing transport; a mule, a cart, a few coolies,
a motor lorry, even an idle railway train, all serve his
purpose as occasion rises, and his motto is "Get there,
if not by fair means, then somehow," and get there he
generally does. He has an uncanny instinct for finding
out the secret destination of his brigade and is often on
the ground, sorting the mail, before the troops arrive.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Sheridan, a very well-known member of
the Department, used to tell an amusing story of the
horror of a senior staff officer meeting him one day on a
frontier road pronounced absolutely unfit for wheeled
traffic. Mr. Sheridan was driving along merrily with the
mails in a two-horsed tonga; it was the shortest road
and he took it, and the staff had to reconsider seriously
their strategic plans, simply because the Superintendent
of the Postal Service would not act according to military
instructions.</p>

<p>The heart of the field postal system in any campaign
is the Base Office. It is there that all information concerning
the movements of regiments and units is carefully
recorded. Lists of officers are kept in alphabetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
order, and these lists are kept corrected from day to day
on information received from the various field offices.
The Base Office controls the main routes of mails to the
divisional and brigade offices, it issues instructions and
is ready to supply reliefs. It searches for missing men,
disposes of undeliverable correspondence and has a hospital
for repairing articles damaged in transit; in fact,
the smooth running of the whole organization depends
on the work done at the Base.</p>

<p>The arrangements for conveying the mails between the
base office and the field offices devolves on the supervising
officers, and endless difficulties have to be faced in
order to obtain transport. A great deal depends on the
personality of the postal officer in charge. If he is a
pleasant fellow and popular with the transport staff he
can get most things done, but, if he is insistent on his
rights and has not learnt the meaning of "give and take"
on a campaign, he will get nothing but excuses and regrets,
the mail bags will be left behind in the last camp,
irate Colonels will write to their personal friend the
Director-General and the promising career of a conscientious
public servant will be seriously injured.</p>

<p>In Appendix H is given a list of the most important
expeditions in which field post offices have been employed,
with a brief account of the arrangements made
on each occasion. Most of these were small frontier wars
and little difficulty was felt in providing the personnel.
The Great War, however, was a very different matter.
It necessitated the despatch of large numbers of post
offices all over the world, and the demand on the resources
of the Post Office of India was on such a vast
scale that an account of it has been reserved for a separate
chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

THE INDIAN FIELD POST OFFICE DURING THE GREAT WAR</h2>


<p>In 1914, when war broke out, a large postal contingent
accompanied the troops sent to France.
It was under the control of Mr. Pilkington,
Assistant Director-General of the Post Office, who
had the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and it comprised
one Base Office and 22 field offices, with a staff of 13
supervising officers, 22 field postmasters, 84 clerks and
78 menials. During the early years of the war the work
performed by this staff was very heavy. Frequently over
23,000 letters and 2000 parcels would arrive for the
Indian contingent in one day, while newspapers published
in England were regularly received for delivery to the
troops. At the end of 1916 the Indian field postal staff
in France was considerably reduced, as large numbers
accompanied the Indian troops transferred to Egypt and
Mesopotamia, and at the end of the war only one or two
field offices remained to serve some Labour Corps units
which had been left behind.</p>

<p>At the end of 1916 Mesopotamia was the most important
theatre of war so far as the Indian Post Office
was concerned. A small field postal contingent was sent
in 1914 and was steadily increased as the operations extended.
Mr. A. B. Thompson, Deputy Postmaster-General,
was the first Director of Postal Services. He
was succeeded in 1917 by Mr. A. J. Hughes, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
been Deputy Director in Egypt. By the end of 1917 the
army was so large and the work of the Post Office so
extensive that it was decided to place an officer of the
rank of Postmaster-General in charge, and Mr. H. A.
Sams, Postmaster-General, Central Circle, was selected
to be Director of Postal Services in Mesopotamia. By
1918 the staff consisted of 17 superintendents, 45 inspectors,
2 base postmasters, 7 deputy postmasters, 79
field postmasters, 542 clerks and 797 menials. The Field
Post Office in Mesopotamia had not only military work,
but also a great deal of civil work. The magnitude of
the business may be gauged by the following monthly
figures:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="right" colspan="2">ABOUT</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Number of letters received and despatched</td><td align="right">12,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Number of parcels received and despatched</td><td align="right">70,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Number of money orders issued and paid</td><td align="right">67,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Value of money orders issued and paid</td><td align="right">Rs.30,00,000</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Large numbers of British postal orders were also sold and
Savings Bank business was freely transacted.</p>

<p>During the year 1916 a great deal of difficulty was experienced
in Mesopotamia in dealing with returned
letters, the addressees of which could not be traced. To
dispose of these a Returned Letter Office was established
at Basra, for which a staff of 165 permanent base men
was employed. Subsequently, as these men were released
or recalled to military duty, their places were taken
by Anglo-Indian boys recruited in India. The establishment
of the Returned Letter Office put a stop to very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
many complaints regarding loss of letters. The office used
to deal with about 200,000 articles a month and worked
very efficiently under the supervision of the Base Postmaster,
Basra.</p>

<p>Upon the fall of Kut the field post office there shared
the fate of the garrison, and a number of postal officials
were taken prisoners of war by the Turks.</p>

<p>From the beginning of 1918 to the end of the war the
postal service in Mesopotamia was extremely good, and
both in Basra and Bagdad a regular local post was established
and deliveries by postmen were introduced. At
the end of 1918 a number of civil post offices were opened
and steps were taken to close down field post offices
wherever possible. From the 1st May, 1919, the postal
administration of Mesopotamia was finally handed over
to the civil authorities and almost all the field post offices
were withdrawn, but a very large proportion of the Indian
Field staff remained in the country and took service under
the new Iraq Government.</p>

<p>Next in importance to Mesopotamia came the Indian
postal services in Egypt, Palestine and Salonika, and in
these places the Indian field post offices worked side by
side with the British Army Postal Corps. In 1915 they
were under the control of Mr. A. J. Hughes as Deputy
Director, who was succeeded later by Mr. S. C. Sinclair.
In 1915 Indian field post offices were sent to Gallipoli,
and the work done by them there won the warm appreciation
of the military authorities. The extension of
operations to Palestine necessitated the despatch of a
number of field post offices to that country. In 1918 it
was found necessary to separate the postal contingent at
Salonika from the control of the Deputy Director in
Egypt, and the force was placed in charge of Mr. A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Gillespie as an independent Assistant Director, with a
staff of 1 base postmaster, 2 inspectors, 28 field postmasters
and clerks and 36 menials. The Salonika postal
service extended to Baku and Constantinople, where
there were Indian field post offices.</p>

<p>Field post offices were sent to East Africa in 1914 under
the control of Mr. K. A. Appleby, who was subsequently
made a Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel. The organization
consisted of a base office, 25 field post offices, with a staff
of 4 superintendents, 6 inspectors, 1 base postmaster,
25 field postmasters, 76 clerks and 67 menials. About a
million letters and parcels were handled monthly by this
staff, and work had to be carried on under the most trying
conditions, as many of the mail lines traversed country
covered with thick jungle. In 1917 and 1918 the whole
postal service of German East Africa was carried on by
the Indian Field Post Office, and the greatest credit is
due to Lieutenant-Colonel Appleby for the excellent
arrangements made by him.</p>

<p>In 1918 Lieutenant Kilman was sent to take control
of the field post offices attached to the East Persian
Cordon between Meshed and Dalbandin. The East
Persian Cordon was subsequently known as the Force in
East Persia, and the postal organization consisted of 1 Base
post office and 13 field post offices, with a staff of an
Assistant Director of Posts and Telegraphs, 1 inspector,
1 base postmaster, 13 field postmasters, 31 clerks and 54
menials.</p>

<p>A field post office contingent was also sent to Bushire
in 1918 in connection with the operations between
Bushire and Shiraz. This was placed under the control
of Mr. C. F. Quilter as Assistant Director, who was also
given control of the postal arrangements of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Mission Escort in South Persia operating from Bunder-Abbas
to Kerman and Shiraz. The British Mission
Escort commenced its operations early in 1916 and its
postal arrangements were in charge of Captain Greene,
R. E., Superintendent of post offices, prior to their being
taken over by Mr. Quilter. Up to March, 1919, the
postal organization of the Bushire Force and British
Mission Escort consisted of 2 Base post offices and 18
field post offices, with a staff of an Assistant Director, a
Deputy Assistant Director, 2 inspectors, 2 base postmasters,
18 field postmasters, 49 clerks and 86 menials.
From April, 1919, the Force was considerably reduced
and a large portion of the field postal staff was withdrawn.</p>

<p>The operations in the neighbourhood of Aden led to
the establishment of a few field post offices under the
postmaster of Aden, who carried out this work in addition
to his own.</p>

<p>The total number of officials of the Indian field post
offices serving with the various Expeditionary Forces in
1918 was about two thousand, and with this large contingent
serving abroad the Department in India had to
undertake the difficult task of equipping and despatching
regular reinforcements to the several theatres of war.
In order to deal with the enormous quantity of Army
mails, both originating in India and received from abroad,
two special base offices were established, one at Bombay
and one at Karachi. The Base Office in Bombay was
converted in 1918 into a Base Postal Depot, and in addition
to dealing with the mails for the troops it was also
assigned the duty of recruitment and mobilization of
postal reinforcements. The establishment of the Base
Postal Depot in Bombay solved many of the difficulties
which attended the organization of field post offices and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the disposal of mails for armies in the field. The depot
was divided into four main sections for Enquiry, Sorting,
Mobilization and Correspondence. The chief duty of
the Enquiry section was to ensure the correct delivery of
correspondence for the troops that had returned or had
been invalided from the field. This section was in charge
of a lady Superintendent with forty lady clerks, and their
duty was to keep up to date a regular record giving the
names, designations and addresses of officers and men who
had returned to India. The Enquiry section kept its
records by means of index cards, of which there were
over 133,000 when the armistice was declared. About
330,000 letters monthly were disposed of in this section.</p>

<p>In the Sorting section the average number of postal
articles dealt with in a month was about one million.
The sorting of mails for all the forces was done by units,
separate bundles or packets being prepared for the officers
and men with each unit. These mails were then forwarded
ready sorted to the base offices at the various
fronts, where they were distributed to the field offices
serving the units in question.</p>

<p>The Mobilization section dealt with all matters relating
to the mobilization of the staff recruited in India
for service overseas. Only men who had volunteered for
field service were taken, and on receiving orders these men
reported themselves to the Officer Commanding, Base
Postal Depot, Bombay, who arranged for their kit, uniform
and transport to the force for which they were
detailed. The Correspondence section dealt with all
complaints regarding postal articles for the field forces,
and, by being in close connection with the Enquiry
branch, it was able to dispose of a large number of complaints
without delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The Base Postal Depot, Bombay, was thus the most
essential factor in the whole postal organization, and the
smooth working of mail arrangements for the Expeditionary
Forces depended very largely upon its efficiency.
The Depot was directly under the control of the Director-General
of Posts and Telegraphs and in charge of Captain
Love, a pensioned officer of the Department, who had
retired as Presidency Postmaster, Bombay.</p>

<p>To reward the good work done by the Indian postal
staff in the field, no less than fifty-two personal distinctions
were granted and over three hundred men were
mentioned in despatches. The Department may well be
proud of its achievements during the war. Volunteers
were always ready to come forward for service in the
worst places and many lost their lives. The best proof
of their work, however, is the high reputation which the
Post Office of India has earned among all branches of
the Army.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

INDIAN POSTAGE STAMPS</h2>


<p>The first issue of postage stamps in India was
made by Sir Bartle Frere in the Province of
Scinde (now spelt Sind) in 1852. At that
time the post offices of Scinde were administered
by the Local Government, and it was not until
1855 that they were placed under the control of the
Postmaster-General of Bombay. The Scinde District
dawk stamps are very rare. There were three kinds:
(1) the design embossed on white paper without colour;
(2) blue embossed on white paper; (3) the design embossed
on vermilion wafers. The design is shown in the
accompanying illustration (Fig. 1), and the central portion
consists of a modification of the broad arrow used by the
East India Company. The issue was a comparatively
small one, and the stamps were withdrawn from use in
September, 1854.</p>

<p>The early postal system of India was solely used for
official purposes, and it was not until 1837 that a public
post was established. Postage rates varied with distance,
and the charge was levied in cash, the lowest rate being
two annas for every hundred miles. For this purpose
copper tokens of the value of two annas were struck
which were available for the prepayment of postage.</p>

<p>In 1850 a Commission was appointed to inquire into
the working of the Post Office, and among its recommendations
were the formation of an Imperial Post
Office of India under a Director-General, the abolition
of franking and the employment of stamps in prepayment
of postage.</p>

<div class="caption">SHEET OF FOUR ANNA STAMPS, 1854. PRINTED IN CALCUTTA</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a great deal of discussion between the
Indian Government and the Court of Directors in
London as to where the stamps should be manufactured;
the former desired to procure them from England, but
the latter, on the ground of economy, decided that
sufficiently good stamps could be made in India. The
first effort was a design of the "Lion and Palm tree"
made by Colonel Forbes of the Calcutta Mint. This
essay (Fig. 2), however, was never used, as the Mint
could not promise a sufficient supply. Subsequently the
manufacture of stamps was entrusted to the Survey
Office, and after many failures Captain Thuillier, Deputy
Surveyor-General, succeeded in producing nine hundred
sheets of red half-anna stamps by means of lithography.
These stamps are known as the red &frac12; anna stamps
"with 9&frac12; arches" and were printed in sheets of one
hundred and twenty, consisting of twelve rows of ten
labels. They were sent to Bombay on the 5th April,
1854, but after despatch it was found that the stock of
vermilion was exhausted, and as the same quality of ink
could not be procured in India a new ink was prepared
and at the same time a fresh design was made. Owing
to the fresh design, it was decided not to issue the
"9&frac12; arches" stamps. It is disappointing to think that
this first and historic set of Indian stamps was never
used postally; but the omission does not seem to have
detracted from their philatelic value. Good specimens
are very rare, and command a high price in the market.</p>

<p>The design for the &frac12; anna stamp that was finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
accepted was one of eight arches, and it was printed in
blue. There are three distinct shades of blue in the 1854
issues, varying from deep to pale. These stamps were
prepared by engraving on copper plate and transferring
to stones. The sheets consisted of twelve horizontal
rows of eight stamps on paper watermarked with the
arms of the East India Company. The sheets, dated
May and July, 1854, were evidently made up of blocks
of twenty-four stamps, repeated four times on each sheet.
This is apparent from the fact that the fifth stamp in
each of the third, sixth, ninth and twelfth rows is
slightly out of alignment, and the sixth stamp in each of
the first, fourth, seventh and ninth rows has had the
chignon redrawn (Plate facing p. 180). The sheets are
not perforated, and are without gum: 333,399 sheets
were printed in 1854 and 48,831 in 1855.</p>

<p>The 1 anna stamp was printed in vermilion-red, and
26,897 sheets were ready by August, 1854; there were
further supplies of 54,961 sheets in November, 1854, and
15,834 sheets by November, 1855.</p>

<p>The colour selected for the 2 annas stamp was green,
and the printing was completed in October, 1854. There
is no record of the number printed.</p>

<p>The need for a 4 annas stamp was badly felt for postage
to the United Kingdom, which cost 1 rupee 4 annas an
ounce in 1854. A design was prepared in two colours,
blue and red, and the first sheets contained only twelve
stamps (Plate facing p. 178), and the first supply consisted
of 17,170 sheets delivered on 14th October, 1854; in all
61,580 sheets were printed. In April, 1855, a new setting
was adopted with twenty-four stamps on a sheet, and two
arrangements of this setting were made, one with the
stamps much closer together than the other.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>All the stamps referred to above were prepared by
Captain Thuillier, who subsequently became General Sir
Henry Thuillier, C.S.I., Surveyor-General of India.</p>

<p>In November, 1855, stamps of the value of &frac12;, 1, 2, 4
and 8 annas were received from Messrs. De La Rue &amp; Co.
The designs were engraved on steel and the stamps were
printed on white wove unwatermarked paper with white
gum. The 4 and 8 annas are also found printed on a
highly glazed thick bluish paper without watermark.
These stamps supplanted the old issues manufactured in
India, but the stocks of the latter were not finally called
in and destroyed until 1858.</p>

<p>In 1860 8 pies<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> stamps were on sale in India. These
were required for prepayment of soldiers' letters to the
United Kingdom. Up to August, 1855, British soldiers'
correspondence was carried free of charge, but when
this privilege was withdrawn they had the option of
prepaying the postage in cash at 9 pies a tola (2/5 of an
ounce) or else affixing a stamp for 8 pies. Up to 1864
certain changes were made in the colours of some of
these stamps; the 2 annas green was altered to brown-pink
early in 1856, subsequently to buff, and then to
yellow. At the end of 1864 the colour of the 4 annas
was changed from black to green, as the stamp had been
forged.</p>

<p>The 8 annas and 4 annas stamps on bluish glazed paper,
and the 4 annas, 1 anna and 8 pies on white paper, have
been found cut in halves upon postal articles in order to
pay half their face value postage. All covers found with
these bisected stamps were posted in Singapore, which
had an Indian post office at the time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>The first issue of Indian postage stamps with the
elephant's head watermarked was made in 1866. The
values bearing this watermark are &frac12; anna, 8 pies, 1 anna,
2 annas 9 pies, 4 annas, 6 annas, 6 annas 8 pies, 12 annas,
1 rupee.</p>

<p>The 6 annas 8 pies stamps were printed as this was
the rate per ounce for letters to the United Kingdom
via Marseilles between 1863 and 1874. The stamps,
however, were not actually issued until 1867, and their
sale was discontinued in 1874, when the Marseilles route
was abandoned.</p>

<p>Up to 1882 all the Indian stamps printed in London
were of smaller size than English stamps, and they bore
the inscription "<span class="smcap">EAST INDIA POSTAGE</span>." In 1882 new dies
on a larger scale were prepared by Messrs. De La Rue,
and the inscription was changed to "<span class="smcap">INDIA POSTAGE</span>."
The values issued were &frac12; anna 9 pies, 1 anna, 1 anna
6 pies, 2 annas, 3 annas, 4 annas, 4 annas 6 pies, 8 annas,
12 annas, 1 rupee. The stamps were printed on medium
white wove paper watermarked with a five-pointed star.</p>

<p>On 1st January, 1891, the postage to the United
Kingdom was reduced to 2 annas and 6 pies, and a new
stamp was prepared. Until the new issue was ready the
4 annas 6 pies stamps were surcharged with "2&frac12; As."
Bi-coloured stamps of 1 rupee, 2 rupees, 3 rupees and
5 rupees were also printed and a provisional 3 pies stamp
was issued, made by surcharging the &frac12; anna stamp with
"&frac14;" in black. The stamps of 2, 3 and 5 rupees were of
specially large size and bore a later portrait of the Queen
(Fig. 3). This portrait was also adopted for the 3 pies
carmine stamp which was issued in 1899. Owing to the
decision of the Postal Union to have uniform colours
for stamps representing the initial rates of international
postages the colours of the &frac12; anna, 1 anna and 2 annas
6 pies stamps were changed to yellow-green, carmine
and ultramarine. This necessitated a change in the
3  pies from carmine to grey and in the 2 annas from
ultramarine to mauve.</p>

<div class="caption">SPECIMEN VICTORIAN ISSUES</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The King Edward VII issues of 1902-3 were of the
same corresponding values as those of the Queen Victoria
stamps 1882-1900. The colours are 3 pies, grey; &frac12; anna,
yellow-green; 1 anna, carmine; 2 annas, mauve; 2
annas 6 pies, ultramarine; 3 annas, orange-brown;
4  annas, olive-green; 6 annas, bistre; 8 annas, purple;
12 annas, purple on red paper; 1 rupee, green and
carmine; 2 rupees, carmine and yellow-brown; 3 rupees
brown and green; 5 rupees, ultramarine and violet.</p>

<p>In 1906 it was decided to abolish the special receipt
stamp and to use the &frac12; anna and 1 anna postage stamp
for both postage and revenue purposes. A new design
was therefore prepared for these values with the inscription
"<span class="smcap">INDIA POSTAGE AND REVENUE</span>."</p>

<p>In 1909 the double-headed telegraph stamps were
abolished and it was decided to employ postage stamps in
payment of telegrams. The value of telegraph stamps
extended to fifty rupees, but it was considered sufficient
to add three new values to the postage stamps for use
upon the more expensive telegrams, namely 10, 15 and
25 rupees. These stamps are of the same size and design
as the 2, 3 and 5 rupees issues, and the colours are 10
rupees, pink and green; 15 rupees, olive-brown and blue;
25 rupees, orange and blue.</p>

<p>The stamps of George V issued in 1911 were completely
re-designed. The higher values with the elephants as
supporters are very artistic. In 1913 the 2 annas 6 pies
stamp was re-designed and the colour changed from
ultramarine to bright blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1918 the United Kingdom raised the postage
rate to India from 1d. to 1&frac12;d., and, to correspond
with the increase, the Government of India raised the
postage to the United Kingdom to 1&frac12; annas. The new
stamp was intended to be a dark chocolate-brown, but
was printed by Messrs. De La Rue &amp; Co. in a light
chocolate.</p>

<p>In 1866 service postage stamps first came into use for
employment on official correspondence. The &frac12; anna,
1 anna, 2 annas and 4 annas were overprinted with the
word "Service." The first supply was overprinted in
India pending the arrival of the stamps ordered from
England. A consignment of 8 annas overprinted was
also received from England. In 1874 the overprint
was altered to "On H. M. S.," as shown in Fig. 4,
and in 1883 the rupee stamp was also overprinted in
this way.</p>

<p>Various other overprints were used by local bodies in
India, but after a time the practice was forbidden. In
1911 the overprint was again altered to "Service."</p>

<p>The following overprints were also used for Indian
postage in other countries:</p>

<p>There are many varieties of the overprints in the
Indian Convention States stamps and many errors, which
have led to numerous forgeries of the different overprints.</p>

<p>A very exhaustive history of the postage stamps of
India with detailed accounts of errors and provisional
issues will be found in <i>The Postage and Telegraph Stamps
of British India</i>, by L. L. R. Hausburg, C. Stewart
Wilson and C. S. F. Crofton, published by Messrs.
Stanley Gibbons. This is the standard work on the
subject, and it contains many fine plates and illustrations.
Part I, on postage stamps, is written by Mr. Hausburg,
and no article on Indian stamps can pretend to be anything
more than a résumé of his detailed researches.</p>

<p>One merit the Postal Administration of India can
justly claim and that is the purity of its stamp issues.
The simple design of the Sovereign's head has always
been maintained and the temptation to issue fancy
pictures for commemoration purposes has always been
steadily avoided.</p>

<p>The Audit Staff of the Posts and Telegraphs has not been
included as this is under the control of the Finance Department.</p>

<p>Recruitment for the posts of Superintendent is effected in two
ways, namely&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) by the selection of qualified persons not already in the service
of the Department, and</p>

<p>(2) by the promotion of officials from the subordinate ranks of
the Department.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the former case the person selected is generally required to join
as a probationary superintendent, and is not given a permanent
appointment until he has shown his fitness in every respect for
the position and has passed an examination in Post Office work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Ordinarily a probationary superintendent is not allowed to act
as a superintendent until he has had a practical training in postal
work; that is to say, he performs the duties of a postmaster,
accompanies a superintendent on tour and is given an insight into
the general working of the Department in the offices of the
Postmaster-General and Superintendent. There is no minimum
period fixed in which a probationer, when fully qualified, must
receive a permanent post. It depends on the vacancies that occur
in the sanctioned cadre; but experience has shown that the period
seldom exceeds two and a half years, and the average is two years
and two months.</p>

<p>Postmasters are generally recruited from the lower ranks of the
Department, such as sub-postmasters and clerks, who usually start
their careers as probationers. The exceptions to this rule are the
probationary postmasters, who are specially selected in order to
improve the personnel in the higher appointments.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX B<br />

EXTRACTS FROM EARLY REGULATIONS REGARDING THE MAIL SERVICE</h2>


<p>An extract from the Consultations, 17th January, 1774,
gives in detail the arrangement made by Warren
Hastings for the improvement of postal arrangements.</p>

<p>The President lays down before the Board the following
plan for the better regulations of the Dauks and for forming
a General Post Office:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The present management of the Dauks is attended with many
inconveniences. Private letters are exempt from postage and the
whole expense of the establishment falls upon the Company. The
Dauks from the same cause are loaded with packages of the most
frivolous kind and of unreasonable weights. The privilege of
sending private letters by the Dauks being confined to the European
inhabitants, affords but a partial aid to the necessary intercourse
of trade. The establishment is branched out into various
departments, all independent and unconnected, the expense
partly defrayed by ready-money payments and partly by taxes on
the zemindars and farmers, who make an advantage of them in
the deductions of their rents. From all these causes the establishment
is involved in a labyrinth of obscurity, without checks and
without system. The delays on the road are often greater than
those of common cossids or couriers without a possibility of correcting
them, because it cannot be known by whom they are
occasioned. Of these delays the President himself has had repeated
proofs insomuch that whenever he has had occasion for extraordinary
despatch he has made use of express cossids, and these
never failed to exceed the regular Dauks by nearly half the space
of time employed by the latter for the same distance. The loose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>and irregular manner in which the letters are received and distributed
exposes the correspondence of individuals and even the
public despatches to great delays and to the risk of being lost or
intercepted.</p></blockquote>

<p>To remedy these evils, the following plan is submitted to the
Board, for the future management of this office, in which it is
attempted to limit the expense to provide a fund for its support
by laying a moderate postage on private letters, to render it of
more extensive use and to form the different parts into one uniform
and general system.</p>


<p><i>Plan of a new Establishment of Dauks and of a General
Post Office</i></p>

<p>1. That the Dauks be formed into four divisions as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First Division from Calcutta to Ganjam;<br />
Second Division from Calcutta to Patna;<br />
Third Division from Patna to Benares and to such farther<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distance as may be hereafter determined;<br />
Fourth Division from Calcutta to Dacca.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. That no Dauks be appointed to the cross-roads (excepting
Dinagepur) as hereafter mentioned, but cossids only occasionally
employed by the Provincial Councils and Collectors to convey the
letters to the nearest stages of the Dauks; the pay and other
charges of these cossids to be transmitted monthly to the Postmaster-General,
whose office will be hereafter described.</p>

<p>3. That as the military operations in Cooch Behar require a
constant and regular correspondence, a cross-post be established
between Dinagepur and Rajmehal, and that it remains for future
consideration whether it will be necessary to establish a cross-post
from Burdwan on the assembling of the Council at that place.</p>

<p>4. That three hercarrahs or dauks, one massalchy<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and one
drum be appointed to each stage, viz.:</p>

<h2>APPENDIX C<br />

METHODS OF TRAVEL IN EARLY DAYS</h2>


<p>The dak or travelling system prevailing in India in the
year 1857 was almost wholly arranged by the Post
Office and was available for private individuals as well
as for officials. When a traveller contemplated a
journey he applied to the local postmaster for means of transport,
giving, as a rule, two or three days' previous notice. Horse daks,
i.e. wheeled conveyances drawn by horses, were available only on
the great trunk roads, which were metalled. On other roads, the
journey, when not performed on horseback, was accomplished in
a palanquin or palkee, a kind of wooden box, about six feet in
length by four in height, fitted at the sides with sliding shutters
and suspended on two poles borne on the shoulders of four men.
The pleasures of travelling in this fashion have been described by
Bishop Heber and other writers. The traveller provided his own
palanquin, and the postmaster supplied the palkee-burdars or
palanquin-bearers, eight in number, as well as two mussalchees or
torchbearers and two bhangy-burdars or luggage porters. The
charges, about one shilling per mile for the entire set of twelve
men, had to be paid in advance, the traveller notifying the time
and place of starting and the duration and localities of halts.
There was also an extra charge for demurrage or delays on the
road attributable to the traveller himself. For these charges the
postmaster undertook that there should be relays of dak servants
throughout the whole distance, and, to ensure this, he had to
write in advance to the different villages and post stations ordering
relays to be ready at the appointed hours. The stages averaged
ten miles each and were accomplished in three hours, at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of which time the twelve men retraced their steps, having been
succeeded by another twelve; for each set of men belonged to a
particular station. The horse daks were established on the same
system, several pairs of horses or ponies being kept at the different
stages as relays. The bullock train, which was intended chiefly for
baggage and parcels, was largely used for conveyance of troops
during the Mutiny. There were one or two private companies in
existence, but the public as a rule preferred to use the Government
vehicles, as they were considered more reliable.</p>

<p>There were no hotels or inns on the road, but dak bungalows
or rest houses, a convenient substitute, were established at places
varying from fifteen to fifty miles apart, according as the road was
much or little frequented. These bungalows were under Government
control, a khidmatgar or servant and a porter being in
attendance at each, the traveller paying a fixed sum for the use
of his room and making a separate bargain for any few articles of
provisions that might be obtainable. The building was little more
than a thatched house of one story, divided into two or three
rooms, to each of which a bathroom was attached. The khidmatgar
cooked and served the meals ordered, while the porter
supplied wood and water. The dak system was perfected by Lord
Dalhousie, during whose administration many fine metalled roads,
including the grand trunk road from Calcutta to the Punjab, were
completed. The new system was a great improvement upon the
primitive arrangements in force during the Punjab campaign of
1846, when, owing to the tedious nature of the journey and the
slow method of progress, out of one hundred officers sent off by
palanquin from Calcutta to aid Viscount Hardinge only thirty
arrived at the Sutlej before the campaign was over.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX F<br />

HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS OF THE CALCUTTA GENERAL
POST OFFICE</h2>


<p>This handsome building is situated on the west side of
Dalhousie Square at the corner of Koila Ghat Street,
being a portion of the site of the old Fort of Calcutta.
The removal of the old foundations was a work of
great difficulty owing to the extreme hardness of the masonry,
which in many cases had to be blasted away. The building was
erected from designs by Mr. Walter B. Granville, Architect to the
Government of India. It was opened to the public in the year
1868 and cost 6,30,000 rupees. It consists of two lofty storys,
the east and south fronts being faced with tall Corinthian columns
flanked by massive piers in which are the staircases. The south-east
angle of the building is semicircular, also faced with Corinthian
columns leading to a lofty circular hall in which are the public
counters. This is surmounted by a lantern crowned by a dome,
which forms a conspicuous object in the city.</p>

<p>The site of the General Post Office is of great historical
interest owing to its association with the great tragedy of the
Black Hole of Calcutta. On entering the Post Office courtyard
from Koila Ghat Street there are two tablets with the following
inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
I. The brass lines in the stone,<br />
on the adjacent ground,<br />

<div class="center">
II. The two lines of twelve arches<br />
to the west of this tablet<br />
are all that now remains above ground<br />
of old Fort William and<br />
originally formed a portion of the arcade<br />

The Black Hole Prison was a small room<br />
formed by bricking up two arches<br />
of a similar but smaller arcade<br />
within the East Curtain<br />
south of the East Gate.<br />
</div>

<p>The sunken arches, where the Post Office vans were kept, once
formed part of the arcade within the south curtain, the wall line
of which is marked out by brass lines let into the pavement. The
wall of the curtain, a portion of which was still standing in 1895,
backed the old export and import warehouses, and through the
arches one would have in the old days looked into the parade
ground within the Fort. The export and import warehouses were
built against the south curtain in 1741 and would have followed
the line of Koila Ghat Street.</p>

<p>The angle of the south-east bastion and the thickness of its walls
is indicated by brass lines let into the steps of the Post Office. A
tablet pointing out this fact is on the adjacent wall, and the
entrance to the east gate of the Fort is commemorated by a tablet
fixed into the red building opposite the Holwell obelisk:</p>

<h2>APPENDIX G</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Extract from the narrative of the interruption in the mail arrangements<br />
in the N.-W.P. and Punjab subsequent to the Mutiny at Meerut and<br />
Delhi on the 10th and 11th May, 1857.<br />
By <span class="smcap">Mr. G. Paton</span>, Postmaster-General, North-West Provinces.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>On the mutiny of the native troops at Meerut and Delhi
on the 10th and 11th May, 1857, the mail communication
between Meerut, Delhi and Allyghur was interrupted.
The eastern mails were then forwarded from
Allyghur via Anoopshahur and Moradabad to Meerut and thence
direct to Kurnaul or via Seharanpore to Umballa. In like manner
the mails from the north-west were forwarded from Kurnaul and
Umballa to Allyghur. There was delay by the arrangement, but
it was the only one practicable on the route via Delhi being
closed by the mutiny and rebellion there.</p>

<p>2. After the lapse of a week the mail was reopened between
Allyghur and Meerut, but by the mutiny of the 9th Regiment
N.I. on the 20th June at Allyghur all postal communication
from the north, the south, the east and west of that station was
stopped.</p>

<p>3. Exertions were made to establish communication between
Cawnpore and Meerut via Futtehgurh, Bareilly and Moradabad.
Mails were forwarded towards Bareilly, but none issued from or
through that station. This excited much uneasiness for some time,
but was explained by the mutiny of the troops there and at Shajehanpore
on the 30th June. Bareilly was, like Delhi, the scene of
the political intrigue, and the suppression of postal communication
was there, as elsewhere, an object of the first importance with the
insurgents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The post offices and mail lines in Oude, generally, became
disorganized about the same time as in Rohilcund, as the troops
mutinied almost simultaneously in both provinces.</p>

<p>5. While the Grand Trunk Road between Cawnpore and Agra
was open, arrangements were made to maintain communication
between the Punjab and Cis-Sutledge States with Agra via Kurnaul
Hansie and Jeypore, but the mutiny of the Hurrianah Battalion
and a portion of the 4th Irregular Cavalry at Hansie and Hissar
in the end of May entirely stopped that line.</p>

<p>6. An attempt was made to open communication with Agra
and Meerut via Muttra and by a line midway between Khoorjah
and Secunderabad, but it had to be abandoned owing to the rebel
Wulleedad Khan and his followers having obtained undisputed
possessions of the district of Bulundshahur.</p>

<p>7. But, although Bulundshahur and a large portion of Allyghur
were occupied by the rebel Wulleedad Khan, a line of runners was
established between Meerut and Agra via Gurhmooktesur Ghat,
the left bank of the Ganges, Anoopshahur and Allyghur. Letters
of light weight were managed to be conveyed with tolerable safety
by that route, notwithstanding that large sums were offered for
the murder of those caught in the act of conveying English
correspondence.</p>

<p>8. On or about the 5th June the troops at Allahabad, Cawnpore,
Futtehgurh, Hameerpore, Banda Jansie, Lullutpore and Saugor
mutinied; and, in consequence, all the post offices and mail lines
in the Doab and Bundlekund as low down as Mirzapore became
disorganized. Communication between Agra, the Cis-Sutledge
States and Calcutta was then fairly cut off and could not be re-established
by the Grand Trunk Road so long as Delhi remained
in the possession of the mutineers. The route via Multan to
Bombay was, however, open and instructions were given for the
mails to and from the N.-W.P., Cis-Sutledge and Punjab being
forwarded via Lahore.</p>

<p>9. Between Agra and Bombay the mail was not interrupted till
the mutiny of the Gwalior Contingent on the 17th June, and since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
then up to 1st February, 1858, or a period of seven months and
thirteen days, the road via Gwalior and Indore to Bombay was
closed or not practicable and safe for the mail.</p>

<p>10. So soon as it was apparent that the mail between Bombay
and Agra could not be re-established via Gwalior and Indore, the
establishment of runners between Agra, Jeypore, Naseerabad,
Deesa and Ahmedabad was strengthened, and the mails to and
from Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, etc., were very regularly conveyed
by that route.</p>

<p>11. In the course of the month of August, Dr. Clark managed
at Agra to organize an establishment of kossids, thence via Etawah
to Cawnpore, and for very light letters not exceeding a &frac14; tola in
weight the arrangements, although occasionally interrupted, were
generally successful excepting for a period of nearly eighteen days
in the end of November and beginning of December, when the
troops of the Gwalior Contingent crossed the Jumna and invested
Cawnpore. On the defeat of the Gwalior Contingent at Cawnpore
on the 7th December the kossid dak was again useful in keeping
up communication between Agra and Cawnspore until the 5th
January, 1858, when the mail carts were re-established after
having ceased to run from the 5th June, or a period of seven
months.</p>

<p>12. Communication with the province of Kemaon was uninterruptedly
maintained by an establishment of runners posted via
Sreenugger, Teeree, Mussoorie and Deyrah Dhoon.</p>

<p>13. Between Meerut and the Camp at Delhi runners were
posted via Bagput, but they were frequently cut off, and the communication
had to be kept up via Shamlie and Kurnaul or via
Seharunpore and Umballa. When the runners between Meerut
and the Camp at Delhi were intercepted it was frequently impossible
to open direct communication even by kossids, so closely
was the country infested with insurgents.</p>

<p>14. The mail cart establishment between the Camp at Delhi
and Lahore was steadily kept up. Occasionally it was unsafe to
take the carts over the twelve miles leading to and from the Camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and there the coachman rode the horses across country or proceeded
on foot and so managed to elude the insurgents.</p>

<p>15. The mail cart establishment was the only available means
by which officers could travel to and from the Camp before Delhi,
and it afforded them an easy and speedy mode of travelling.</p>

<p>16. Extra horses were posted at each stage between the Jhellum
and Delhi to admit of express cart daks being laid when necessary
for mails or passengers.</p>

<p>17. In the month of August it became necessary to provide
means for the removal of the sick and wounded officers from the
Camp in Delhi to Kurnaul or Umballa, and some of the Inland
Transit Company's carriages, in addition to the palanquin carriages
and vans attached to the Post Office, were hired for the
purpose. All sick and wounded officers were allowed, at the
recommendation of the Brigadier-General, now Sir Archdale
Wilson, to travel free of expense. Many valuable lives were thus
saved.</p>

<p>18. I consider the conduct of the native coachmen beyond all
praise during the disturbances. Great temptations to desert us
were held out to them by the mutineers, but not one of them
proved unfaithful to Government. From the date of arrival of
our troops before Delhi on the 8th June till the 20th of September,
the date of the fall of Delhi, the coachmen conveyed the mails
to and from the Camp with the same safety and the same regularity
as before the outbreak.</p>

<p>19. The public mind of the Punjab and Cis-Sutledge States
was at the highest pitch of excitement watching the result of the
operations of our troops against the mutineers at Delhi, and any
interruption of the mail would have had a fatal effect on the peace
of those States. The telegraph wire connecting the Camp with
the Punjab was frequently cut, and thus it may be easily understood
that the regularity of the mail throughout the crisis was of
the most vital importance.</p>

<p>20.  The Commissioner of Scinde, anticipating the possibility
of the communication between the Punjab and Scinde or Bombay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
being cut off, organized on his own responsibility a mail establishment
between Bhawulpore and Jaudhpore, and again with Deesa
and Hyderabad. This arrangement was useful in conveying intelligence
between Agra, the Punjab and Central India, and also
as an auxiliary line of communication between the Punjab and
Bombay.</p>

<p>21. In the middle and end of July the mail cart establishment
between Googairah and Mooltan became very clamorous and
appeared to be inclined to strike. The vital importance of that
establishment made me determine on travelling to Mooltan so as
to ascertain whether the contractors had any reasonable grievance.
There had been many expresses besides passenger daks, and their
horses had been perhaps somewhat overworked in consequence,
and accordingly I authorized an additional horse at each stage,
which for the time quieted the contractors and they gave no more
trouble. I was not without some suspicion that there were
political influences exciting dissatisfaction amongst them. This
impression was in some degree corroborated by an effort on the
part of the prisoners of the jail at Googairah attempting to effect
their escape. Happily, through the prompt and rigorous measures
adopted by the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Elphinstone, the
<i>émeute</i> amongst the prisoners was most successfully crushed and
the peace of the district was not disturbed. Otherwise the mails
would have there been interrupted.</p>

<p>22. On the 14th September insurrection broke out between
Googairah and Hurruppa. Many horses of the mail cart establishment
were carried off by the rebels. Several carts were burnt,
and communication by the direct route between Lahore and
Mooltan was for several days wholly cut off. The local authorities
of the district had no warning of the outbreak till the morning of
the night on which it took place. The District Officers gave me
reason to hope that the insurrection would be instantly put down,
but unfortunately, owing to their paucity of troops, the rebels
were not overawed sufficiently to admit of the mails being conveyed
by the direct road within fifteen days. In the interim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
however, they were, after several days' stoppage, conveyed via
Shahpore and Seeah to and from Mooltan and Lahore.</p>

<p>23. It is here worthy of remark that the successful assault of
Delhi on the 14th September by our troops was telegraphed to
Lahore, and full particulars thereof were transmitted by the mail
of that date from Lahore to Mooltan, Scinde, Bombay, etc., before
the outbreak between Googairah and Humppa. The receipt of the
news of the successful assault of Delhi was signally opportune in
Scinde, as the native troops then at Karachi, Hyderabad and
Shikarpore were in a state approaching to open mutiny.</p>

<p>24. The route for the mail between Lahore and Mooltan via
Shahpore being very circuitous and also unsafe as the country
between the Sutledge and Ravee and even for some distance west
of the Ravee was in open revolt, it became necessary to determine
on having a more direct line of communication between Lahore,
Scinde and Bombay. Accordingly a camel dak was established by
the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab between Bhawulpore
and Ferozepore. The head overseer of the Jullunder Division,
Hurdeo Bux, was transferred for the superintendence of this dak
and managed it most successfully.</p>

<p>25. The establishment of runners between Ferozepore, Lahore
and Loodianah was at the same time strengthened in view to
provide for the extra weight of the mails in transit via Bhawulpore,
and thus the stations east and west of the Sutledge were rendered
independent of the direct mail line between Lahore and Mooltan
in respect to Scinde, Bombay, Calcutta, etc., etc.</p>

<p>26. The post offices and mail lines at and above Meerut and
throughout the Cis-Sutledge States and Punjab have continued
in uninterrupted operation excepting those situated on the line
of road between Googairah and Humppa, which were for a short
time the scene of insurrections in September.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX H<br />

THE WORK OF THE FIELD POST OFFICE BETWEEN 1867 AND 1912</h2>

<div class="center"><i>The Abyssinian Expedition.</i></div>


<p>At the end of September, 1867, the Postmaster-General,
Bombay, reported that a reconnoitring party under
Colonel Merewether, Political Agent, had left for
Abyssinia and a Field Force was shortly to follow. A
post office under Mr. J. Gardiner as Inspecting Postmaster sailed
for Abyssinia on the 25th November along with the second
detachment of the Expeditionary Force. A portion of the staff
was left at Massowah, where the troops disembarked, and the rest
was ordered to advance with the Army. Having fallen ill through
overwork, Mr. Gardiner was replaced by Mr. E. de C. Williams
on the 1st March, 1868.</p>

<p>Ordinary postage stamps were used, the denominations of the
stamps supplied for the Field Force being &frac12; anna, 1 anna, 2 annas,
4 annas, 6 annas 8 pies, and 8 annas 8 pies. The postage payable
on articles for members of the Expeditionary Force was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Letters</span>&mdash;4 annas for every &frac12; oz., 8 annas for 1 oz. and
8 annas for every additional oz. in excess of the first oz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newspapers</span>&mdash;8 pies for 4 ozs., 1 anna 4 pies for 8 ozs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books</span>&mdash;2 annas for 4 ozs., 4 annas for 8 ozs. and 4 annas
for every additional 8 ozs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Prepayment in the latter two cases being compulsory. It does not
appear that parcels or money orders were exchanged or Savings
Bank transactions allowed.</p>

<p>The postal officials began to return from Abyssinia by the end
of June, 1868, the last batch arriving at Bombay on the 4th July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>


<div class="center"><i>The Afghanistan Expedition.</i></div>

<p>The war broke out in November, 1878, and Mr. J. H. Cornwall
was appointed to take charge of postal arrangements with the
column under the command of General Stewart, Mr. W. T. van
Someren with the column under the command of Major-General
F. S. Roberts, and Mr. J. L. Fendal with the Peshawar column.
The approximate strength of the whole force was about 45,000
fighting men and 60,000 camp followers. The mails between
Quetta and Kandahar were conveyed under the control of the
Political Agent and the military authorities.</p>

<p>When General Roberts moved out, a hill cart service was opened
from Kohat to Thull, a distance of sixty-four miles, in the Kurram
Valley. The principal difficulty was the work of organizing and
maintaining the mail lines, which were also used for conveying
military stores. Apart from the work done at the Post Office
workshops at Aligarh, workshops had to be opened at Rawalpindi,
Jund, Thull and other places for the construction and repair of
carts. In this expedition non-commissioned officers were taught
to do postal work, and whenever they were required to do so they
were allowed a postal salary of Rs.30 a month.</p>

<p>The control of the whole postal arrangements devolved upon
Colonel W. M. Lane, Postmaster-General, Punjab, and it was due
to his exertions that the arrangements met with success.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Malta Expeditionary Force.</i></div>

<p>In April, 1878, it was decided to send an Expeditionary Force
to Malta under Major-General J. Ross, C.B., and at the instance
of the military authorities a small postal staff, consisting of a postmaster
(Mr. Dinshaw Jijibhoy) with a clerk and three peons, was
selected to accompany the troops. The postal arrangements were
made under the direction of the Postmaster-General, Bombay, and
the Expeditionary Force started from Bombay on the 1st May,
1878.</p>

<p>When the island of Cyprus was ceded to Great Britain by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Turkey the Indian Contingent went to occupy it, and the postal
staff was accordingly ordered to embark for Cyprus. A British
post office was opened at Larnaka and Mr. Dinshaw was placed
in charge of it, and there he worked conjointly with the British
postal staff till his return to India on the 22nd August, 1878.
Shortly after Sir Garnet Wolseley came out from England as
Governor, and the island was then divided into six parts, each
with a Civil Commissioner and garrisoned by a regiment. The
Commissioners were ex-officio postmasters of their respective
divisions, and there was no regular arrangement between these
divisions for the exchange of mails, which were occasionally conveyed
by means of Japties or policemen. When Cyprus was first
occupied there was only a fortnightly communication with India
by means of the Austrian Lloyd Steam Navigation Company's
steamers; subsequently a weekly service was also established by
the Bells Asia Minor Line of steamers. A small Austrian post
office at Larnaka was permitted, and this served the entire island.
The field post office was opened at Malta on the 27th May and
closed at Cyprus on the 22nd August, 1878.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Egypt Expeditionary Force.</i></div>

<p>In the beginning of July, 1882, the Government of India
directed an Expeditionary Force of about 7000 men of all arms
for service in Egypt under the command of Major-General Sir
H. Macpherson, V.C., K.C.B.</p>

<p>The postal arrangements were made by Mr. Fanshawe, Postmaster-General,
Bombay, and Mr. J. H. Cornwall, who had special
experience of the management of field post offices in Afghanistan,
was selected as the Chief Superintendent of Field Post Offices.</p>

<p>The Indian field post office establishment started from Bombay
on the 22nd August, 1882, and returned there on the 31st October
of the same year.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Kalahandi Expedition.</i></div>

<p>The rising of Khonds in Kalahandi, an important feudatory
State in the Chattisgarh Division in Central Provinces, necessitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the despatch of troops. In June, 1882, the Deputy Postmaster-General,
Central Provinces, reported that the rising was of
a serious character and that the country was not likely to be quiet
for some time. The troops marched from Sambalpur and Raipur,
and three field post offices were opened to serve them.</p>

<p>Mr. P. Gorman, Superintendent of the Division, was in entire
charge of the postal arrangements. The expedition lasted for only
a short time, but the communications had to be maintained till
about the end of the year.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Suakim Field Post Office, 1885.</i></div>

<p>In February, 1885, it was decided to send an Expeditionary
Force composed of Indian troops to Egypt, and the Director-General
was asked to make arrangements for a field post office to
accompany it. Mr. O'Shea, as Chief Superintendent, was in
charge of the postal staff, under the direction of the Postmaster-General,
Bombay.</p>

<p>The strength of the Expeditionary Force was 10,517, including
followers, and General Hudson, C.B., was in command of the
force. The postal staff started from Bombay on the afternoon of
the 24th February, 1885, and on the 7th March, 1885, arrived at
Suakim, where the Base post office was opened on the 8th current.
Mails were exchanged between Egypt and India by Government
transports and P. &amp; O. packets. Only two officers, Messrs. O'Shea
and Lalkaka, received medals, and none were granted to the
subordinate postal staff. The field post office was closed in
November, 1885.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Upper Burma Expedition.</i></div>

<p>On the 23rd October, 1885, the Government of India asked the
Director-General to make the postal arrangements for the Expeditionary
Force in Upper Burma. The strength of the Force
consisted of 10,000 fighting men and 2000 followers, besides 1000
dhooly bearers and 3000 coolies. On the 10th November, 1885,
the Expedition, under the command of Major-General H. N. D.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Prendergast, C.B., V.C., left Rangoon for Upper Burma by
steamers up the Irrawaddy river to Thayetmyo and thence by the
land route to Mandalay. Mr. G. Barton Groves, Deputy Postmaster-General,
Burma, was called on to organize the service and
accompany the Force as Deputy Postmaster-General in charge.
The Rangoon, Prome and Thayetmyo post offices were strengthened,
and the last-named was converted into a Base office. Five
field post offices were also opened on board the head-quarters
steamers of each of the five brigades which composed the force.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Pishin Field Force.</i></div>

<p>In March, 1885, the Governor-General in Council decided to
increase the garrison in Baluchistan to a strength of three divisions
comprising about 25,000 men and 20,000 followers, and the necessary
postal arrangements had to be made. Mr. J. Short, Deputy
Postmaster-General, Sind and Baluchistan, was in charge, assisted
by Mr. E. Walker, Inspector of post offices.</p>

<p>In April, 1885, a head office was opened at Rindli, in Baluchistan,
which was designated the "Pishin Force Frontier Office," and the
Quetta post office was strengthened. Nine camp post offices were
also opened, and mails were carried to these offices by camels and
sowars.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Sikkim Expedition.</i></div>

<p>The orders for the despatch of a force for operations in Sikkim
were notified in the <i>Gazette of India</i> of the 3rd March, 1888.
Shortly after the commencement of hostilities the Government
of Bengal requested Mr. H. M. Kisch, Postmaster-General, Bengal,
to open a runners' line from Siliguri to Kalimpong, a distance of
thirty-seven miles. This line was used only for transmission of
letter mails, parcel mails being conveyed by the old route from
Darjeeling via Ghum and Pasok. On the 24th March the Padong
post office was converted into a sub-office, and from that date it
was constituted a Base office for the expedition.</p>

<p>On the 16th March the force, which concentrated at Padong,
moved out in two columns, one under Brigadier-General T.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Graham, R.A., commanding the expedition, and the other under
Colonel Michel, of the 13th Bengal Infantry, the former advancing
towards Fort Lingtu and the other towards the Rhenok Bazar.
With the advance of troops the post office opened at Dulapchin
was shortly removed to Ranglichu. Other post offices were opened
at Gnatong, Sedonchin, Gangtok, Rhenok Bazar and Pakyong.
The mail lines connecting these offices were under the management
of the Post Office as far as Ronglichu and Pakyong, but the
lines beyond were under the Political authorities.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Black Mountain or Hazara Field Force.</i></div>

<p>Towards the beginning of September, 1888, the Home Government
having decided to send a punitive expedition against the
tribesmen of the Black Mountain, a Field Force was organized on
the Hazara frontier. The object of the expedition was to punish
the Khan Khel Hassanzai and the Akazai tribes. Brigadier-General
J. W. McQueen, C.B., Commanding the Punjab Frontier
Force, directed the expedition. On the 8th September, 1888,
Mr. W. T. van Someren, Superintendent of post offices, Rawalpindi
Division, was deputed to make the postal arrangements with
the force. Haripur was constituted a Base office for the Derband
column, and Abbottabad for the Oghi column. The tonga service
from Hassan Abdal to Abbottabad was strengthened and extended
to Mansera, and a mixed tonga and horse service was established
between Abbottabad and Oghi. A runners' line was opened from
Haripur to Derband. A railway sorting office, under the supervision
of Mr. N. G. Wait, was also opened at Hassan Abdal for
the sorting and onward transmission of articles for the Field Force.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Chin Expedition, Burma.</i></div>

<p>In December, 1888, a small force of about 1200 men, besides
civil officers and followers, headed by Brigadier-General Faunce,
started for the Chindwin Division to quell a rising of Burmans
and to reduce to order the country which was then infested with
dacoits. The expedition was undertaken very suddenly, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Quartermaster-General in India asked the Deputy Postmaster-General,
Burma, to arrange for the opening of a field post office
at Kalemyo at a distance of twenty-seven miles from the base of
operations at Kalewa. About July, 1889, the country was brought
to a normal state and the troops were withdrawn.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Lushai Expedition.</i></div>

<p>In 1888 the Government of India having decided to send a
punitive expedition against the Shendus and other tribes in the
Chitagong Hill Tracts, a small force under Colonel V. W. Tregear
was organized and concentrated at Demagiri. The force was
styled the "Lushai Expeditionary Force," and consisted of about
1200 men besides followers and coolies. An inspector was deputed
to make the postal arrangements. The boat line from Rangamati
to Demagiri, which was maintained by the Frontier Police, was
strengthened, also the post offices at Rangamati and Demagiri, the
latter being constituted a base office, and a post office was opened
at Barkul&mdash;half-way between Rangamati and Demagiri&mdash;where
there was a stockade of military police. The troops kept the field
for about four months and came back at the end of April, 1889.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Chin Lushai Expedition.</i></div>

<p>In 1889 two armies operated in this expedition, one from Burma
and the other from Chittagong. The troops in Burma were
divided into two columns, one operating from Fort White as a
base against the Syins and other tribes, and the other starting
from Gangaw as a base and advancing via Yokwa on Haka. The
Chittagong force advanced from Fort Lungleh on Haka. Brigadier-General
W. P. Symons commanded the operations on the
Burma side, and Colonel Tregear commanded the Chittagong
column. The strength of the force concentrated at Gangaw
consisted of about 40 officers, 1200 European and Indian troops
and 2500 followers. The strength of the Chittagong column consisted
of about 3500 men besides followers and coolies.</p>

<p>On the Burma side much difficulty was experienced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
supervising officers in organizing and maintaining the lines, which
lay over sandy beds of rivers, hillocks and jungles and on the
Chittagong side, on account of constant illness and the consequent
change of officials deputed. Mr. J. W. McCrea, Superintendent
of post offices, Burma Circle, was deputed to make postal arrangements
for the force under the direction of Mr. G. J. Hynes,
Deputy Postmaster-General, Burma. On the other side postal
arrangements were made by Mr. G. S. Clifford, Superintendent
of post offices, under the direction of Mr. G. Barton Groves,
Deputy Postmaster-General, Eastern Bengal.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Zhob Expedition.</i></div>

<p>The object of the expedition was to explore the borders of the
Zhob Valley and to take steps either to capture the outlaw Dost
Muhammad or to expel him from the Kakar country and to coerce
the Khiddarzai Shirani tribe into submission.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of September, 1890, intimation was received
from the Quartermaster-General in India that a force of
about 2000 men, besides camp followers, was about to start for
the Zhob Valley, and on the 27th of that month a small field post
office, consisting of a sub-postmaster and two peons, started from
Quetta with a portion of the troops for Hindubagh, which was
to be the general rendezvous. The expedition was commanded
by Sir George White.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Black Mountain Expedition.</i></div>

<p>In 1891 a force was sent for operations against the Hassanzai
and Akazai tribes of the Black Mountains. The strength of the
force, which was under the command of Major-General Elles, C.B.,
was about 6800 men, and it advanced from Darband in two
columns&mdash;one marching via Baradar and Pailam to Tilli, and the
other along the river route via Kotkai and Kunhar. The postal
arrangements were made by Mr. W. T. van Someren under the
direction of Mr. G. J. Hynes, Postmaster-General, Punjab.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>


<div class="center"><i>The Chin Hills Expedition.</i></div>

<p>The Government of India sanctioned military operations in the
north and east frontier of the Bhamo district and Chin Hills
during the cold season of 1891-92. In the Bhamo direction the
object of the expedition was to explore the amber and jade mines,
the Hukong Valley and the country on the east and north-east
frontier above the Taeping river on the Chinese border. The
expedition had a quasi-military character, and about 5000 troops,
including police battalions, operated in various columns, under
the direction of Major-General R. C. Stewart, commanding the
Burma districts.</p>

<p>Mr. F. McCrea, Inspector of post offices, Eastern Division, was
deputed to organize and supervise the arrangements.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Manipur Expedition.</i></div>

<p>The outbreak in Manipur in 1891, and the consequent massacre
of Mr. Quinton, the Chief Commissioner of Assam, and his party,
necessitated the despatch of troops to quell the rebellion. The
force was designated the "Manipur Field Force," and about
2500 men, including followers, operated from the Tammu side
and about the same number from Kohima and Silchar. Mr. W.
Roussac was in charge of the postal arrangements with the Tammu
column, and Mr. F. P. Williams, assisted by an inspector, with the
Kohima column. All correspondence for the Tammu column was
sent from India to Rangoon and thence by boats to Kindat.
From Kindat to Tammu the mails were conveyed by runners, and
a runners' line was opened from Tammu to Manipur. These
arrangements worked for a very short time on account of the rapid
advance of troops and their immediate return.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Miranzai Expedition.</i></div>

<p>The object of the expedition, which was under the command
of Brigadier-General Sir William Lockhart, K.C.B., was to overawe
the recalcitrant Samil clans of the Urakzai tribe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Miranzai Valley. The force was ordered to the front in January,
1891,  and advanced in three columns, the first column having its
base at Shahu Khel, the second at Tog and the third at Hangu.
Mr. A. Bean, Superintendent of post offices, Peshawar Division,
was placed in charge of field postal arrangements connected with
the force in addition to his own duties.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Wuntho Expedition.</i></div>

<p>On the 15th February, 1891, the station of Kawlin was suddenly
attacked by a party of rebels from the Wuntho State, in Upper
Burma, and a few police who formed the garrison of the place
had to evacuate it. The post office had to be abandoned and the
sub-postmaster had to come away along with the other officials.
A combined force of police and military, consisting of about 2500
men, was at once organized and advanced on Wuntho from
Shwebo, Katha and Tigyaing to put down the rebellion and bring
the country under permanent occupation. The troops employed
were not designated a Field Force, and the postal arrangements
were therefore carried out on ordinary scale and not according to
the rules of the Field Service Manual.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Isazai Field Force.</i></div>

<p>In September, 1892, the Government of India decided to
send out an expedition under Major-General Sir William Lockhart
to punish certain villages of the trans-Indus Isazai clans
who had harboured Hashim Ali Khan of Seri in contravention
of their agreement entered into at Seri in May, 1891. A
force of about 4000 men of all arms concentrated at Derband and
was styled the "Isazai Field Force." On the 17th September,
1892,  Mr. C. J. Dease, Superintendent of post offices, was deputed
to make the special arrangements for the force with the assistance
of an inspector.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Kurram Field Force.</i></div>

<p>In the beginning of October, 1892, the Government of India
decided to depute a Political officer at the head of a force in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Lower Kurram Valley. The object was to expel the Chikkai tribes
from the valley and to effect a thorough settlement of the country.
The force which accompanied the Political officer, Mr. W. R. H.
Merk, C.S.I., consisted of about 2500 men, including followers.
Mr. P. Sheridan, Postmaster-General, Punjab, arranged for field
post offices, and the Superintendent of post offices, Peshawar
Division, was placed in charge. By the end of October the presence
of troops in Kurram was no longer necessary, and the field
offices were closed with the exception of the head-quarters office,
which was retained for the use of the garrison.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Wano Expedition.</i></div>

<p>In August, 1892, owing to disturbances in Afghanistan, a detachment
of troops had to be sent beyond the frontier to take up
position at Kajuri Kuch in the Wano country, thirty miles beyond
the Gomal Pass. As there was no post office at the place, arrangements
were made by the Superintendent of post offices, Derajat
Division, to send and receive mails via Gomal post office. In
September, however, owing to the despatch of further troops, the
Post Office was called upon to make arrangements. By the end
of April, 1893, the strength of the Kajuri and Jandola forces was
considerably reduced, and the postal establishments were gradually
abolished.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Abor Expedition, 1894.</i></div>

<p>The only postal arrangements made in connection with this
expedition, which lasted for a very short time, were the opening
of a runners' line from Sadiya to Bomjur and the strengthening
of the delivery staff of Sadiya post office by an additional postman.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Waziristan Field Force.</i></div>

<p>In August, 1894, the Government of India sanctioned the
despatch of troops to accompany the British Commissioner in
connection with the Afghan boundary demarkation. Pundit Shiv
Pal, the Superintendent of post offices, Derajat Division, was
placed in charge assisted by two inspectors, till he was relieved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Mr. W. T. van Someren, who was placed on special duty in this
connection. The post office at Tank was temporarily converted
into a Base head office, and three field post offices were opened to
move with the force.</p>

<p>On the 3rd November the Mushud Waziri made a determined
night attack on the British camp at Wano, and, although the
attack was repulsed, it resulted in 120 casualties. In the beginning
of December, 1894, the Government of India having sanctioned
active operations in Waziristan, Lieutenant-General Sir William
Lockhart, who was now placed in command, asked for an
additional Superintendent, and Mr. A. Franks Ryan was placed
on special duty with the force.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Chitral Relief Force.</i></div>

<p>In the middle of March, 1895, a scheme was prepared for field
operations in Chitral, the object of which was to compel Umra
Khan of Jandol to withdraw from the Chitral country, and the
Director-General was requested to make postal arrangements for
the force, which consisted of about 20,000 troops of all arms and
about 30,000 camp followers. This was the largest force mobilized
in India since the Afghan War of 1879, and the postal arrangements
had therefore to be made on a proportionately large scale.
The expedition was titled "The Chitral Relief Force" and was
commanded by Major-General Sir Robert Low, K.C.B.</p>

<p>On the 18th March, 1895, Mr. P. Sheridan, Postmaster-General,
Punjab, was requested by the Director-General to arrange field
post offices, and by the end of the month the postal staff, who were
collected at Nowshera, were in readiness to start. Mr. A. Franks
Ryan was the senior Superintendent in charge. In the early
stages of the campaign considerable difficulty was experienced by
the supervising officers in organizing lines for the conveyance of
mails. Mule transport being very limited, pack bullocks had to
be used for the first few days, and when those were withdrawn a
temporary runners' line had to be opened. Information, however,
was shortly received that the country was open as far as Durgai,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
a distance of forty-one miles from Nowshera, and arrangements
were made with Messrs. Dhanjibhoy to open a tonga line.</p>

<p>On the 30th March the force moved out to Mardan and the
head-quarters field post office went with it. On the 22nd April,
1895, information was received that Colonel Kelly had succeeded
in reducing the Chitral fort from the Gilgit side, and a further
hasty advance of troops was therefore no longer necessary. With
the occupation of the Chitral territory by the 3rd Brigade the
expedition practically came to an end. The Abbottabad Force
was broken up on the 31st May, 1895.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Suakim Expedition, 1896.</i></div>

<p>In May, 1896, under orders from the Home Government, an
Expeditionary Force, 3000 strong, was sent to Suakim under the
command of Brigadier-General C. C. Egerton, C.B., D.S.O., and
a field post office was ordered to accompany it. The chief of the
postal staff was Mr. Bennett, who, however, did not hold the rank
of Chief Superintendent as the Force was too small. It started
on the 22nd May, 1896, and arrived on the 1st June at Suakim,
where the Base office was opened. Subsequently a sub-office was
opened at Tokar, and the exchange of mails between this office
and the Base office was carried on by camel dak twice a week.
There was fortnightly communication between India and Suakim
by Egyptian steamers, and parcel and letter mails were conveyed
by these and by P. &amp; O. steamers. The field post office was closed
on the 8th December, 1896.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Malakand Field Force.</i></div>

<p>On the 31st July, 1897, the Adjutant-General in India forwarded
to the Director-General a scheme for operations in the
Malakand country, and Mr. P. Sheridan, Postmaster-General,
Punjab and N.-W.F., was requested to make special postal arrangements
for the force. Mr. H. C. Sheridan, Assistant Director-General
of the Post Office, was placed in charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>By the middle of August all the troops forming the 1st and 2nd
Brigades went across the Malakand to the Swat Valley. In the
meantime, fresh trouble having arisen round and about Peshawar,
the Government of India issued orders for punitive operations
against the Mohmands, who had invaded British territory and
attacked the village and fort of Shabkadar, nineteen miles from
Peshawar. Accordingly a strong force was concentrated about the
place, and Mr. C. A. Stowell was deputed to Peshawar to make
special postal arrangements for this force. "The Mohmand Field
Force," under Major-General Ellis, left Shabkadar on the 15th
September and returned to Peshawar on the 8th October, 1897.
During the expedition a small force was sent to Abazai to guard
the works of the Swat Canal, and a field post office accompanied
it.</p>

<p>On New Year's day of 1898 orders were issued for an advance
to Buner, and the 2nd Brigade marched to Katlang, which was at
once connected with Mardan by an ekka service, later extended to
Sanghao. There were now two ekka services&mdash;one from Mardan
to Rustam, a distance of nineteen miles, and the other from
Mardan to Sanghao, a distance of twenty-one miles. On the 9th
January the name of the force was changed to the "Buner Field
Force." The postal arrangements for this force, which was not
in existence for more than a fortnight, were in the hands of
Mr. N. M. Cama, Superintendent of post offices.</p>

<p>The Malakand Field Force began to be demobilized on the 22nd
January, 1898, but only a small portion of the troops returned to
India. The rest went forward and became part of the Swat
garrison. In this expedition arrangements were made for the first
time for the sale of newspapers by field post offices, a service which
was greatly appreciated. So efficient were the postal arrangements
and the regularity of the tonga service that the mails to and from
the front travelled with a punctuality which would compare
favourably with any long-established line in India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>


<div class="center"><i>The Tirah Expedition.</i></div>

<p>On the 17th September, 1897, the Director-General was asked
to make arrangements for a postal service for the Expeditionary
Force to be sent against the Afridi and Orakzai tribes on the
Kohat and Peshawar frontier. The Postmaster-General, Punjab
and N.-W.F., Mr. P. Sheridan, was immediately communicated
with, and Mr. van Someren was appointed Chief Postal Superintendent
with the expedition.</p>

<p>The Base post office for the main force was at first situated at
Kohat, and the Base office for the Peshawar column at Peshawar.
When the troops marched through Tirah and took up their position
for the winter in the Bara Valley, the Khyber Pass and the neighbourhood
of Peshawar, Messrs. Dhanjibhoy established two tonga
services connecting Peshawar with Bara and Jamrud, while beyond
these places they arranged for the carriage of mails by a
horse post. The mail service for the Peshawar column previous
to this had been carried on by the Afridi horse contractors, and
as the roads were improved the tonga services were extended up
to Landi Kotal in the Khyber Pass and Gandao in the Bara
Valley.</p>

<p>The postal arrangements lasted for a period of six months. On
this occasion, too, the field post offices were specially authorized
to sell newspapers to the troops and were allowed a commission
on the sales.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Tochi Field Force.</i></div>

<p>The postal arrangements in connection with the Tochi Field
Force lasted for a period of about eight months, from July, 1897,
to February, 1898.</p>

<p>The base of the operations was Bannu, which is 111 miles away
from the railway at Khushalgarh, and, as soon as it was known
that a force was to be mobilized at Bannu, arrangements were
made for the introduction of an efficient tonga service from
Khushalgarh to that place and for a proper railway connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
between Golra and Khushalgarh. Between Khushalgarh and
Kohat a feeble tonga service was already in existence under the
management of the District Board of Kohat, while for the local
demands an ekka service had been established between Kohat and
Bannu. Neither of these lines could be relied upon to meet the
special requirements for mails and passengers caused by the expedition,
and Mr. Dhanjibhoy, the mail contractor of the Rawalpindi-Srinagar
line, established a complete and efficient tonga
service over the entire distance.</p>

<p>The postal arrangements were carried out very satisfactorily.
Mr. W. T. van Someren was in charge of the actual arrangements
in the field from the beginning till September, 1897, when he was
relieved by Mr. F. O'Byrne, who remained in charge during the
remainder of the operations.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Tochi Valley Field Force.</i></div>

<p>After the breaking up of the Tochi Field Force in December,
1897, it was decided to retain in the valley a brigade of troops on
field service scale under the command of the General Officer
Commanding, Tochi. The troops were quartered in six military
posts, and camp post offices were opened to serve them. During
the Tochi Expedition there was a tonga service between Edwardesabad
and Bannu, but this having been discontinued a new
arrangement had to be made for a tonga service with Messrs.
Dhanjibhoy and Sons for the conveyance of mails between
Khushalgarh and Kohat and an ekka service between Edwardesabad
and Miranshah and Datta Khel.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Swat Valley Column.</i></div>

<p>When the second division of the Tirah Force was demobilized
it was decided to retain a strong column in the Swat Valley to
take up positions in Dir territory for the protection of the line
of communications and the route of the relieving and relieved
Chitral Force. The arrangement necessitated the opening of three
field post offices from the 1st May, 1898, and from the same date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the Swat Sorting Office at Nowshera was strengthened. It was
also decided to retain the services of a Superintendent to accompany
the column up to Dir territory and return with the relieved
troops from Chitral.</p>

<p>The postal arrangements had to be maintained till the end of
June, when the column having been considerably reduced, two
field offices were abolished and only one was retained till the 15th
July, 1898.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Mishmi Expedition.</i></div>

<p>In November, 1899, the Director-General was requested to open
a field branch post office at Bonjur and connect it by a runners'
line (twenty-four miles long) with Sadiya, where there was a civil
post office. This place was made the base of operations of the
Mishmi Field Force. About 200 military police and 1000 regular
troops operated in this expedition, which began in December,
1899, and ended in January, 1900. The Bonjur office was opened
on the 1st December, 1899, and closed on the 9th February, 1900.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The China Expeditionary Force.</i></div>

<p>At the request of the Home Government, a force entitled
"The China Expeditionary Force" was mobilized in India for
service in China under the command of General Sir A. Gaselee.
The first intimation of the despatch of the army was received on
the 29th June, 1900. This, however, referred only to one brigade
of troops of all arms; but on the 25th June intimation was received
that a force of two brigades with divisional troops were
under orders for China. The control of the field postal arrangements
was in the hands of Mr. Stewart-Wilson, Postmaster-General,
Punjab, under whose orders the postal staff was mobilized
and equipped. At first it was decided to fit out twelve field post
offices to accompany the force. Mr. W. T. van Someren was
appointed Chief Superintendent, and Mr. A. Bean and Mr. A. B.
Thompson were selected to work under him.</p>

<p>By the end of August, 1900, the force in China was strengthened
by a cavalry brigade, one infantry brigade and three large coolie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
corps, and the postal staff had to be supplemented. Thus by the
end of the year there were in China:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>On the 29th June, 1900, a notification was issued regarding the
conditions under which postal articles could be exchanged with
the China Expeditionary Force. The Indian Base office was at
first opened at Linkung-tao (Wei Hai Wei), but was shortly transferred
to Hongkong. Articles for the force were despatched by
the steamers of the B.I.S.N. Company, the Messageries Maritimes
and also by the Opium steamers to Hongkong. The Colonial
post office at Hongkong had an arrangement with all merchant
vessels binding them to carry mails as far as Shanghai, and owing
to the courtesy of the Postmaster-General, Hongkong, this concession
was made use of to carry the mails of the Field Force.
North of Shanghai the mails were carried by transports and
men-o'-war. Later on the Chinese Imperial Postal Authorities
carried our mails from Shanghai to Taku and back free of charge
until the latter port was closed by the winter ice. Another route
had then to be chosen for the North China mails, and once more
we had to resort to the kindness of the Imperial Chinese Post Office,
who agreed to supply transport from Chifu to Chaingwantao twice
a week on condition that half the cost of the coal used should be
paid. Thus the mails were conveyed from Hongkong to Shanghai,
from Shanghai to Chifu and from Chifu to Chaingwantao and
thence to Tientsin. The chief postal land routes were (1) Taku
to Pekin and (2) Tientsin to Shanhaikwan.</p>

<p>Dollar currency was used in the field offices, the rate of a dollar
being fixed at 1s. 11d., equivalent to Rs.1.7.0. The first postal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
detachment took with them a full supply of postage stamps, postcards,
etc., but it was found inadvisable to use them owing to the
fact that it would be impossible to sell them at a price exactly equivalent
to face value. At Hongkong the postal equivalent for
10 centimes, i.e. 1 anna, is 4 cents. It followed, therefore, that
twenty-five 1-anna stamps could be bought for a dollar and that
the purchaser would be able to make 2 annas for every dollar spent
on stamps, and it was feared that advantage would be taken of
this to buy up Indian stamps wholesale for remittance to India.
The postage stamps were therefore overprinted with the letters
"C.E.F.," i.e. "China Expeditionary Force," so that their use
would be localized, and the surcharged stamps came into circulation
about the middle of August, 1900. In order to confine the
use of field offices to the members of the force, orders were issued
that our postage stamps should not be sold except to soldiers and
officers in uniform. The rates of postage fixed for all purposes
were those in force in India, the postage to India being reckoned
at Indian inland rates.</p>

<p>Difficulty had all along been felt in supplying postal facilities
to the small bodies of troops stationed at or near railway stations
where there were no post offices. Mr. van Someren removed this
difficulty by introducing a combined Post and Railway Mail
Service between Pekin and Taku and Tientsin and Shanhaikwan,
a scheme which was a new one in the history of the field postal
service. Postal clerks had not only to sort letters in the trains, but
also to receive and deliver letters and sell postage stamps at each
railway station. By August, 1901, there was a reduction of the
number of troops in China and fourteen field post offices were
closed, the supervising staff being reduced to a Chief Superintendent
and an inspecting postmaster in North China and a
Superintendent and an inspecting postmaster at Hongkong. Mr. van Someren
left China on the 5th August, 1901, leaving Mr. Thompson
in charge.</p>

<p>This was the first occasion that a large postal establishment had
to be sent out with a military expedition overseas to a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
country. The force consisted of over 37,000 men stationed at
various places from Shanghai to Taku and Taku to Pekin. The
harmonious relations with the Chinese Imperial Postal Administration
and the material assistance which it rendered on every
possible occasion greatly helped to the success of the Indian Field
Post Office administration in China.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Somaliland Field Force.</i></div>

<p>The postal arrangements made to serve the Somaliland Field
Force extended over a period of nearly two years from January,
1903, to November, 1904. Mr. Wynch, who was appointed Chief
Superintendent, remained till June, 1904, when he was invalided
and relieved by Mr. A. J. Hughes, who held charge until the end
of the operations. The strength of the force was 3000, and at
first one base office and one field post office, with one postmaster,
five clerks and four packers, were provided. Mails were exchanged
between India and Somaliland by Government transports. The
field post offices were closed on the 25th November, 1904.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Tibet Mission.</i></div>

<p>In 1903 the Government of India decided to send a small force
to escort the Tibet Frontier Commission. At first a number of
temporary post offices and lines were opened under the control of
the Superintendent of post offices, Jalpaiguri Division, to serve
the Mission, but it was not until it was decided that the Mission
should advance into the Chumbi Valley that field post offices and
lines were required. The Mission was headed by Colonel Younghusband
and the escort was commanded by General MacDonald,
with Mr. H. Tulloch as Chief Superintendent.</p>

<p>The rapid development of field post offices necessitated the
appointment of a second Superintendent, and Mr. A. Bean was
deputed to field service. On the 6th January, 1904, Mr. Bean
took over charge of the Base Division, but shortly after died of
heart disease on the 3rd March, 1904. The entire arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
then devolved again on Mr. Tulloch until the 1st April, 1904,
when Mr. C. J. Dease took over charge of the Base Division.</p>

<p>The Mission advanced on Gyantse on the 4th April. From
Tuna to Gyantse the mail arrangements were in the hands of the
military authorities, and only one postal clerk, whose duty it was
to distribute letters, was sent up with the escort. The Mission
reached Gyantse on the 14th May, and a field post office had to
be opened there and at several other places on the lines of communications.
The force remained at Lhassa from the 3rd August
to the 23rd September and returned to Gyantse on the 6th
October, 1904. There was by this time at Gyantse an accumulation
of over 1100 parcels addressed to the members of the Lhassa
column, but Mr. Angelo, who was then placed in charge of the
advance division, disposed of them in three days before the troops
left on their return march. The demobilization of the force began
by the end of October, and the postal officials were ordered to
leave Chumbi on the 26th and to close the field post offices between
Chumbi and Gangtok on their way down. Mr. Tulloch relinquished
charge of the F.P.O.'s on the 28th November, 1904.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Bazar Valley Field Force.</i></div>

<p>The postal arrangements made to serve the Bazar Valley Field
Force extended over a period of twenty-five days, from the 13th
February to the 8th March, 1908. On the night of the 12th
February the Chief of the Staff informed the Postmaster, Peshawar,
that the force would leave the station the next morning. A
base office, four first-class field post offices and three second-class
field post offices were sent to the front, and on receipt of the
scheme for the organization and mobilization of the force on
the 14th February this establishment was reduced considerably.
The work of the field post offices on this occasion was limited
almost entirely to the disposal of articles of the letter and packet
mails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>


<div class="center"><i>The Mohmand Field Force.</i></div>

<p>The postal arrangements made to serve the Mohmand Field
Force extended over a period of thirty-eight days, from the 28th
April to the 4th June, 1908. The first intimation that an expedition
would take place was received on the 23rd April, and the
Postmaster-General, Punjab and N.-W.F., was at once directed to
make all arrangements to serve the troops that were concentrating
on the frontier. Mr. McMinn, who was Chief Superintendent
of post offices with the Bazar Valley Field Force, was placed in
charge.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Abor Expeditionary Force, 1911-12.</i></div>

<p>The postal arrangements made to serve the Abor Expeditionary
Force extended over a period of about one year, from May, 1911,
to May, 1912. A temporary post office was first opened on the
15th May, 1911, at Saikwaghat, a terminus of the Dibru-Sadiyah
Railway, to serve the troops making preparations there for the
expedition. The office was under the control of the Superintendent
of post offices, Upper Assam Division. It was not until
September, 1911, when the force advanced towards Kobo, that
the Department was called upon to organize a field postal service.
The arrangements were placed under the control of the Postmaster-General,
Eastern Bengal and Assam, and for the supervision
of the work in the field Mr. A. J. Faichnie, Superintendent of post
offices, Upper Assam Division, was, in addition to his own duties,
appointed Superintendent of Field Post Offices, assisted by an
inspector.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX J<br />

THE POST OFFICE INSURANCE FUND</h2>


<p>The suggestion to establish a State Life Assurance was
first made in 1872 by Sir Richard Temple, the Finance
Member of Council. After a great deal of discussion
it was dropped in 1873, but was revived again in 1881
by Mr. Hogg, the Director-General of the Post Office, when it
was accepted by the Viceroy's Council and finally by the Secretary
of State.</p>

<p>The principal features of the scheme which was actually introduced
on the 1st February, 1884, were:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) For the time the Fund was confined to the employés of the
Post Office.</p>

<p>(2) Provision was made for effecting life insurance in three
ways, viz.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(i) By a single payment.</p>

<p>(ii) By monthly payments until the person insured
attained the age of 50 or 55.</p>

<p>(iii) By monthly payments during life.</p></blockquote>

<p>(3) Provision was also made for two classes of monthly allowances,
viz. "Immediate" or "Deferred."</p>

<p>(4) One life could be insured for any sum which was a multiple
of Rs.50 up to the total of Rs.4,000, and the monthly
allowance granted on any one life might consist of any
sum which was a multiple of Rs.8 up to the limit of
Rs.50.</p>

<p>(5) Medical examination of proposers for insurance was made
free.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>(6) Arrangements were made for the deduction of the monthly
premia from the insured person's salary except the first
premium or premium paid during leave without pay.</p>

<p>(7) Policies and contracts issued under the scheme were exempt
from stamp duty.</p></blockquote>

<p>The scheme worked smoothly, and, taking into consideration
that many employés of the Post Office are poorly paid officials, a
fair measure of success was attained during the first few years
except in the Monthly Allowance branch and in the system of
Life Insurance by single payment. The following figures show
the proportion of officials who availed themselves of insurance
during the first three years:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">1884-85</td><td align="right">1·05%</td><td align="center">of the whole</td><td align="center">Post Office</td><td align="center">establishment.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">1886-87</td><td align="right">1·79%</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="center">"</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>In 1887 the rule under which one-half surrender value could be
allowed on all policies and contracts when payment had been discontinued
was modified so as to exclude from this privilege policies
and contracts on which three years' premia or subscriptions had
not been paid. In September, 1887, the Fund was opened to the
Telegraph Department, and in 1895 to employés of the Indo-European
Telegraphs and to women employed in all the departments.</p>

<p>With effect from the 1st February, 1898, the benefits of the
scheme were extended generally to all permanent Government
servants whose pay was audited in Civil or Public Works Account
offices and all members of establishments of the Military Department,
under audit of the Military Account offices, who were
subject to Civil rules. From the same date a system of Endowment
Assurances providing for payment at any age between 45
and 55 was introduced. With this general extension of the scheme
it was decided that the medical examination of proposers for
insurance should be more stringent and that medical officers, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
had until then been examining proposers for insurance free of any
charge, should be allowed a fee of Rs.4 for each examination, as
their insurance work would be substantially increased. In the
same year (1898) the system of Life Insurance by a single payment
which had proved to be a failure, was abolished.</p>

<p>In 1899, Temporary Engineers and Temporary Upper Subordinates
of the Public Works Department were allowed by Government
to be admissible to the benefits of the Fund, provided that
the Chief Engineer declared that they were eligible for admission.
In 1903 it was extended to permanent Government servants in
foreign service in India, and in the same year Life Insurance
policies were allowed to be converted into Endowment Assurance
policies.</p>

<p>In 1904, the following relaxations of the rules were sanctioned
with a view to meet the convenience of Government
servants.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Insured persons who had retired from the service and whose
pensions were paid in India were allowed the option of
deducting their premia or subscriptions from their pension
bills instead of being compelled to pay them in cash
at a post office.</p>

<p>(2) When there was any difficulty in the way of a proposal being
signed by the proposer in the presence of his immediate
superior, this duty might, with the permission of the
Postmaster-General, be performed in the presence of the
local postmaster or any other responsible officer who had
to sign the certificate.</p>

<p>(3) The table of subscriptions for "Immediate Monthly
Allowance," which contained rates up to the age of sixty,
was extended so as to provide for contracts with persons
above that age.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same year the benefits of the Fund were extended to
Temporary Lower Subordinates, clerks of the Public Works Department
and to clerks of the Punjab University on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
conditions as to Temporary Engineers and Temporary Upper
Subordinates.</p>

<p>The year 1907 witnessed several important changes in the Post
Office Insurance Fund made on the recommendation of the
Government Actuary. These were:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) That the sums eventually payable in respect of policies in
existence on 31st March, 1907, in the Life Branch of the
Fund were increased by 10 per cent and that the premia
payable in respect of sums assured in that branch after
that date would be correspondingly reduced. The rates
of premia for Life Insurance were revised accordingly.</p>

<p>(2) That a life policy, with monthly payments payable till death,
was allowed to be converted into a life policy with
monthly payments payable to a specified age or into a
fully paid up policy payable at death.</p>

<p>(3) That an endowment policy might be converted into a paid-up
policy payable at some anterior date or at death, if
earlier.</p>

<p>(4) That insurants could reduce their monthly premia to any
desired extent from any specified date.</p>

<p>(5) That when a policy of either class was surrendered the policy
holder should be given the full surrender value which on
an actuarial calculation could be paid without loss to the
Fund, instead of half that amount as hitherto given.</p>

<p>(6) That the surrender value of a lapsed policy was payable at
any time after default, on application being made for the
same.</p>

<p>(7) That the period up to which payment of arrears of premium
or subscription was allowed for the revival of a policy of
less than three years' duration was extended from three
to six months.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tables of premia, introduced at the time the Fund was
started, as already stated, were calculated on the mortality rates
which had been deduced from the experience of the Uncovenanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Service Family Pension Fund, Bengal&mdash;a Fund which was confined
to Europeans resident in India&mdash;there being no more reliable
mortality statistics available for the purpose at the time. In 1909
the India Office Actuary, in his review on the operations of the
Fund for the year 1907-08, noticed that, in view of the rapid
growth of the scheme, it was necessary to revise the tables according
to more accurate mortality statistics. In his review on the
work of the Fund for 1908-09 the Actuary asked for detailed
particulars of all the policies issued by the Fund since its institution
in the form of statements, in order to enable him to deduce
therefrom the necessary mortality rates, and thus prepare fresh
tables of premia. These statistics were submitted with the
Director-General's Annual Report on the operations of the Fund
for the year 1910-11.</p>

<p>In the meantime it was brought to notice in 1909 that, under
the existing method of calculating surrender values of Life policies,
the values in certain cases were found on calculation to be considerably
in excess of the total amount of premia paid on the
policies. Taking advantage of this, insurants began to surrender
their policies in large numbers. The matter was referred to the
Secretary of State. As a result, the Actuary at the India Office
forwarded revised tables for the calculation of surrender values
of Life policies, to be used until the general revision of the Mortality
tables and of the tables of premia, which had been under
contemplation, was effected. In 1909 an important concession
was sanctioned regarding the payment of premia by insured
persons while on leave or suspension or when retiring. It was laid
down that an insured person should not be considered as in arrears
of premium or subscription for any month so long as he has not
drawn any pay, pension or suspension allowance.</p>

<p>In 1910, with a view to afford greater facilities to the lower
grades of postal servants to insure their lives and to popularize the
Fund, sanction was obtained to grant to these officials from the
Post Office Guarantee Fund travelling expenses actually incurred
by them in their journey for examination by the medical officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
for insurance, provided the proposer actually took out a policy
and paid the premium for not less than twelve months. In 1912
Mr. Ackland, the Actuary at the India Office, made a thorough
investigation into the past experience of the Fund from the
statistics furnished to him. He drew up a report showing the
results of the investigation and prepared fresh tables of mortality
statistics, as well as new tables of premia for both Life Insurance
and Endowment Assurance. He also prepared new formulæ for
the calculation of paid-up policies, surrender values, etc., and
recommended the following further concessions and changes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The grant to all policy holders on the 31st March, 1912 (the
valuation date), of a bonus at the rate of 2 per cent per
annum in the case of Whole Life Assurances, and at 1 per
cent in the case of Endowment Assurances in respect of
each month's premium paid since 31st March, 1907, up
to 31st March, 1912.</p>

<p>(2) The grant of an interim bonus at half of the above rates in
respect of the premiums paid since 31st March, 1912, in
the case of policies which became claims by death or survivance
between 1st April, 1912, and 31st March, 1917,
provided that premiums have been paid for at least five
years and up to date of death or survivance.</p>

<p>(3) "Age next birthday" should be taken as the age at entry
for all classes of Assurances.</p>

<p>(4) An integral number of years' premia should be charged on
Endowment Assurance policies and Life policies with
limited payments.</p>

<p>(5) Transfers from the Whole Life to the Endowment Assurance
class or vice versa should be allowed only after any
number of complete years' premia have been paid.</p>

<p>(6) When surrender values were granted in the Monthly Allowance
class, medical examination at the policy holder's
expense should be insisted on and payment should in no
case exceed 95 per cent of the present value of the
monthly allowance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<p>(7) Policy holders should be allowed to commute future premia
by payment either of a lump sum or of an increased
monthly premium ceasing at age 50 or 55.</p>

<p>(8) Transfers from the Endowment Assurance to the Whole
Life class should be allowed only on the production of a
fresh medical certificate obtained at the policy holder's
expense.</p>

<p>(9) The valuations of the Fund should be made at quinquennial
intervals.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was also decided that, as an Actuary had been appointed by
the Government of India, all questions relating to the administration
of the Fund, as well as future valuations of the Fund, might
be dealt with by that officer instead of being submitted to the
Secretary of State.</p>
